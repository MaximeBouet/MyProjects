The item is highly durable, elegant and a wonderful addition to your Home Decor. It comes in a Fancy red/blue colored gift box and can be readily turned into a wonderful Anniversary, Wedding, Diwali, Valentine gift item. CARE TIPS Dusting - First, use a soft brush or clean cotton cloth to dust. Removing Candle Wax - Candle wax can be removed from a silver holder by simply running hot water over the area containing the wax. The softened wax should be easy to pry out with a finger. Never risk scratching the piece by using a knife or other sharp object. Washing and Drying - Once all dust and wax are removed, wash the item by hand with warm water and a gentle dish washing soap to remove any food but don't soak the silver in water for any length of time. Rinse the piece well with clean water, distilled is best, and dry immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth. A hair-dryer set on warm helps to dry hard-to-reach places. After your pieces are clean and completely dry, wrap each of them individually with acid-free buffered tissue, butter paper or washed cotton, linen, or polyester to store. Do not use woolor newspaper, which can cause excessive tarnishing that will be difficult to clean, or even worse can remove silver plating. Safely Display Brass items in Your Home - If you'd like to display your Brass items rather than storing it, a glass-enclosed cabinet makes a good choice. Avoid unvarnished wood shelves that can omit harmful vapors and can cause tarnishing.Glass shelves are preferred over wooden shelves.You'll have to avoid displaying or storing silver near cotton felt, wool or velvet as well."

Q1 - What is a LED downlighter/panel? A - A downlight or an LED panel is a ceiling light which goes into the ceiling. You need to have a false ceiling to install this type of lighting. Q2 - What is the difference between a downlight and panel? A - A downlight is rear lit. This means the LEDs are present on the back side of the product. A panel is edge lit; this means the LEDs are present on the side of the product. Downlights traditionally provide better uniform lighting. However for home lighting applications, panels are equally good. Q3 - What should I keep in mind while buying a downlight/panel? A - There are many options available in this category and it can be quite confusing! Here are some things to keep in mind while purchasing new lights for your home. 1. Uniform lighting promise: It may happen that when you multiple pieces of the same product, you may get different brightness from each installed piece. Philips guarantees uniform brightness and same colored light from every single piece you purchase and install in your home. 2. Wide Voltage Protection: It is important that the lights in your home are able to withstand voltage fluctuations. Philips offers the widest voltage protection in the market ranging from 160V to 360V 3. Surge protection: When the voltage fluctuates or when there is frequent power cut offs, you need a product which is robust enough to withstand all this. Philips offers a surge protection of 2.5KV 4. Warranty: Philips LED products come with Duramax Technology. This is a 2 year warranty from the date of purchase or 27 months from the date of manufacture.

These airtight and leakproof containers are scientifically designed for stacking both upwards and sideways to save space in your kitchen. They can also be used to carry food and beverages without the fear of spilling when you are on the go. That gives you every reson why you should go for it. 				    	 					 From the Manufacturer        At a Glance...  Convenient food-storage containers Airtight and watertight Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic Food-safe and hygienic 4-sided locking system with silicone seal Durable construction Stackable and nestable for space-saving storage Microwave- and dishwasher-safe Available in a variety of shapes and sizes    Lock&Lock Food-Storage Solutions Save Food, Save Money, Save Space A useful addition to any busy household, Lock&Lock's Classic plastic food-storage containers come in handy for storing fresh and frozen foods--from healthy snacks like cut-up fruits and vegetables to leftovers or dinners for the week. They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required.    Ideal for wet or dry food storage. Airtight Containers with Four-Sided Locking System    Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Detailed Features Patented Blocking Hole System    Consistent flow of resin--does not produce a weld line along the hinge. Inconsistent flow of resin--produces a weld line over time.   Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or ""wings"" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container.  Lid's 4 wings come with holes that line up with base Weld line does not form around the hinge piece Hinge is designed to be short in length to prevent stiffness when opening and closing    Blue hollow-center silicon band in the lid helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Special Silicone In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. Permeability When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better.   Strawberries stored at room temperature for 5 days. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight.   Airtight seal means no messy spills or leaks to worry about. Excellent Airtight Seal Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring.   Passed the KEMTI bending test. Durable Design Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently).   Hygienic and food-safe. Healthy Living Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly.   Nest and stack for space-saving storage. Space-Saving Design When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage."

Household,"Miamour Thermoplastic Push Lock Soap Holder, White Suction/Push Lock Technology: The pressure difference between the atmosphere on the outside of the cup and the low-pressure cavity on the inside of the cup keeps the cup adhered to the surface. Suction cup adheres to the surface of an object to be handled because the pressure under the cup has been lowered. Removal/Resetting of the suction cup: When the user ceases to apply physical pressure to the outside of the cup, the elastic substance of which the cup is made tends to resume its original, curved shape which make it possible to be reused. Weight and size: These two indicators determine the number and size of the suction cups needed. In our product we have given high importance to these two factors and we have also positioned the suction cup relative to the center of gravity which makes it more sustainable and durable. Utilization: This product perfectly works on any non-porous surfaces like ceramic tile, glass, mirror, granite, stainless steel, acrylic, laminate and surface with glossy finish. The greatest advantage with this type of technology is that that no drilling or no holes are to be done on the surface.

Later that same year, Rhonda’s book of The Secret was released. It has been translated into more than fifty languages and remains one of the longest-running bestsellers of this century. Rhonda has written three more bestselling books: The Power in 2010, The Magic in 2012, and Hero in 2013. 				    	 					 From AudioFile Audio seems like the natural medium for Rhonda Byrne's blockbuster motivational book on positive thought for positive results. The Australian TV producer leads listeners through her exposition on the secret of life. Quoting from an array of New Age gurus and interpreting more traditional teachers as well, the program integrates sound bites from the various authors, with actors taking many of the roles. Neale Donald Walsh, Denis Waitley, Jack Canfield, and dozens of others make cameo comments throughout the program. Byrne's slightly whispery, intimate voice calling the listener to believe alternates with hyped ""you-can-do-it"" encouragement from speakers like Bob Proctor. Kudos goes to the production team that integrated the dozens of speakers--some just introducing who will speak next. The resulting audio keeps a rapid pace hop-skipping along to support Byrne's premise of the essential ""Law of Attraction.""

But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He studies the riddles of everyday life—from cheating and crime to parenting and sports—and reaches conclusions that turn conventional wisdom on its head. Freakonomics is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They set out to explore the inner workings of a crack gang, the truth about real estate agents, the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, and much more. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, they show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives—how people get what they want or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing.

Books,"Funskool Pictureka Game Pictureka! is a new kind of game, both in mechanic as in artwork. The mechanic is invigorating with its large square gaming tiles. The game board is composed of 3 by 3 game tiles, so the game board on which is played is a huge square of 63 cm x 63 cm. This is large enough for several players to be able to play the game at the same time. The game board is “alive”, it is not a static board as the tiles are flipped over, turned and moved. So it is not possible to memory map the board. The mechanic of an ever changing board makes it not only fun; also the challenge is kept into the game all the time. Players will have to throw a color dice at the beginning of their turn. According to the color thrown (3 possibilities) they must draw a mission card of the same color. There are 3 kinds of missions. Be the first one to have successfully accomplished 10 missions. Each successful mission gives 1 point, so be the first one to get 10 points.The artwork is something not to be found in ‘standard' games. The personal drawing style of the artist Eugene makes this a kind of playing artwork. Product Features: Find it fast, find it first! Exciting game of visual hide and seek. Players compete to collect the most mission cards to win the game. Great for the whole family, and kids as young as six can play with older kids and parents. 100 different mission cards in 3 categories.

Unpredictably rewarding.” —Haruki Murakami, from the Introduction“Assembled by longtime Haruki Murakami translator Jay Rubin (and blessed with an introduction by Murakami himself), this handsome 576-page tome is cleverly organized by theme rather than chronology, giving the book a stronger sense of cohesion than if it had started in the 19th century and ended with stories from today. . . .

Books,"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari Review Everyone loves a good fable, and this is certainly one. The protagonist is Julian Mantle, a high-profile attorney with a whacked-out schedule and a shameful set of spiritual priorities. Of course it takes a crisis (heart attack) to give Mantle pause. And pause he does--suddenly selling all his beloved possessions to trek India in pursuit of a meaningful existence. The Himalayan gurus along the way give simple advice, such as, ""What lies behind you and what lies before you is nothing compared to what lies within you."" Yet it is easy to forgive the story's simplicity because each kernel of wisdom is framed to address the persistent angst of Western white-collar professionals. Here is the story of Julian Mantle, a superstar lawyer whose out-of-balance lifestyle leads him to a near-fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom. His physical collapse brings him into a spiritual crisis that forces him to confront the condition of his life. Hoping to find happiness and fulfillment, he embarks upon an extraordinary odyssey to an ancient culture, where he discovers a powerful system to release the potential of his mind, body, and soul and learns to live with passion, purpose, and peace. Brilliantly blending ancient spiritual wisdom of the east with contemporary success principles of the West, this inspiring tale provides a step-by-step approach to living with greater courage, balance, abundance and joy.

Books,"The Adivasi Will Not Dance: Stories Review ‘Shekhar is the sort of writer who appears only rarely in the literary establishment. His voice is powerful, political, urgent. Yet, there is no reason to imagine that politics overpowers the plots—his concerns are deeply literary, his style, effortles’ —Scroll.in ‘[Stories] written from the margin, against the grain, and told with great skill and humanity. Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar is a writer to be sought out and discovered.’ —The Indian Express ‘[There’s] no easy way to read this collection…Shekhar’s tone is calm, even low-key, but he shakes us out of our stupor with his political, ear-to-the-ground stories.’ —The Financial Express ‘The Adivasi Will Not Dance represents a collection of little histories that are contributing to the character of India as a developing, diverse and evolving nation…Shekhar’s work in this volume is a tribute to lives of struggle and marginalisation, carefully avoiding the exotic or self-pitying tone. His craft is suffused by love for his people that reminds readers of Baba Nagarjuna’s poetry—familiar and distant, angry and lyrical.’—Himal Southasian ‘Mr Shekhar is one of India’s most promising writers, his stories deft, compassionate and sharp-edged… His way of seeing is unflinching but not didactic. Mr Shekhar captures an album of people’s lives.’ —Business Standard ‘Shekhar’s writing brings aspects of India that the grand narratives in Indian English writing have often ignored. Through characters that are powerless in so many ways, and by fusing an indigenous realism to the content of his writing, Shekhar has created a fresh and much-needed idiom for the Indian experience.’ —Deccan Herald ‘Shekhar, one of the five writers shortlisted for The Hindu Prize 2017, produces a no-holds-barred work on the life of the marginalized that seems less fiction and more the stuff of life. He doesn’t veil these voices in literary flourishes or what he calls “classic literary tropes”. His characters are flesh and blood, the stories difficult to stomach, the language brutal.’ —The Hindu ‘Hansda Sowendra Shekhar tells the story of people whose ordinariness makes them special.’ — The Hindu ‘From the first page of the first story in The Adivasi Will Not Dance, it has become clear that we have entered a world new to Indian readers.’— Biblio ‘He is clearly a writer to follow, someone whose work promises a fresh look at Adivasi lives.’ —Biblio ‘Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar is a writer to be sought out and discovered. May his tribe increase.’ —The Indian Express  ‘Adivasi will not Dance, by Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, in its ten short stories, leads the reader towards the horizon of destitution and exclusion…yet the provocations one experiences while reading the work is irresistible.’—Mainstream Weekly About the Author Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar is a medical officer with the government of Jharkhand. He is also author of the critically acclaimed novel The Mysterious Ailment of Rupi Baskey which was shortlisted for The Hindu Prize 2014 and the Crossword Book Award 2014.

Is a true romp of a board book, with cartoon farm animals that are wacky enough to make you laugh out loud, and rhymes clever enough to sustain those nearly infinite re-readings: ""Stand with the donkey / Slide with the sheep / Scramble with the little chicks - cheep cheep cheep!"" Now, here's a woman who really knows how to use an active verb. -- Parents, June 1994The popular illustrator and greeting-card artist brings oddball humor and plenty of sassy energy to Boynton on Board, a quartet of concept board books. Each volume features a die-cut front cover framing a picture of its ebullient cartoon stars. A zany sensibility gives an extra bounce to the otherwise conventional counting book One, Two, Three! A similar silliness suffuses Dinosaurs , which explores opposites. In Barnyard , farm animals dance a boisterous, breathless, knee-slapping reel called, with great panache, by a fiddle-playing cow: ``Bow to the horse. / Bow to the cow. / Twirl with the pig if you know how.'' The rowdy crew in Monsters bursts in upon a mild-mannered hippo and makes ``the mess that monsters make,'' but returns to make amends. Fresh and buoyant, these books are good, clean fun. Ages 1-4.

He studies the riddles of everyday life—from cheating and crime to parenting and sports—and reaches conclusions that turn conventional wisdom on its head.

(Rod Liddle, Sunday Times)His overall thesis, that a guilt-driven and exhausted Europe is playing fast and loose with its precious modern values by embracing migration on such a scale, is hard to refute.

Such a work is Douglas Murray's tremendous and shattering book, The Strange Death of Europe.

As the daughter of famed conceptual artist Dennis Oppenheim. By age nine, Chandra was staying up late at her parents art-world parties, collaborating in her father s projects, and performing her own plays at downtown hotspots such as The Kitchen and Franklin Furnace. This set the stage for Chandra s course-altering collaboration with members of The Dance, who were looking to form yet another project and found their muse/fuse in 10 year-old Chandra. Transportation EP, originally released in 1980 by The Dance s own label, ON/GoGo. Balancing on razor- wire guitars, liquid basslines, and dub-style melodica, the Chandra band unveiled their first four songs: Opposite , Concentration , Subways , and Kate. While Chandra s music can be compared to her no wave contemporaries Y Pants, France s Lizzy Mercier Descloux, Su Tissue of Suburban Lawns, or Delta 5 meets the Jackson 5 , to quote critic David Ma, her lyrical fixations are truly singular. With hypnotic, chanted vocals focusing on chilling themes of mind control, multiple personalities and missing the train. At age 12, the post-punk pre-teen took the stage with her band for the first time at New York s legendary Mudd Club. A whirlwind of press coverage ensued from glossy magazines like Vogue and Paris Match to the influential underground zine Non LP B Side and a Soho News cover story. The infectious, propulsive Get It Out Of Your System opens Chandra s second EP with one of her most commanding performances. Stranger slows the pace with stop-start rhythms, woozy synths, and the harmonized return of the melodica, while its lyrics find her being followed by a mysterious character revealed to be a woman. Tish Le Dire sounds like The B-52s in an eerie alternate universe with instructions on speaking up to your parents or authorities to the point of threatening suicide. Chandra stepped away from the band at age 14 to focus on her education. Sadly, the second EP was shelved and would not see the light of day for decades. Chandra s trip continues with this new deluxe reissue from Telephone Explosion Records. Returning her debut EP to its original foursong, single-record release at a dancefloor-ready remastered 45 RPM, the expanded edition also adds to the second EP with a pair of never released songs from her 1983 four-track cassette demos. Day Without Success and They re All Alike find Chandra s dreamlike vocals driven by minimal wave synth zaps and pulsating drum machines Transportation EPs"" will be released on gatefold 2xLP / digital on November 9th, 2018."

Books,"Islam is good Muslims should follow it AUTHOR’S NOTE I humbly say that my approach is slightly different. For example, this book has a chapter not specifically on Islamic Sharia, but on, “JUSTICE: By Muslims, and Others”. It juxtaposes the Islamic methods against that of other societies over the ages. I sincerely could not figure out how the Islamic method could claim to have evolved out of two very humane documents, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah, and yet produce such outlandish juristic decisions as it does at times in the name of Islamic Sharia. I have tried to evolve a new concept which I call, THE THIRD FACTOR. It constitutes the last chapter, and is also mentioned in the opening pages of the book. There are some other deliberations in the book which a reader may find interesting. For example, I have tried to argue that contrary to common perception, the Quran discourages the Muslims to produce more children (pp. 198-201); Prophet Muhammad’s Hadith about “women in hellfire” is wrongly interpreted by his critics (pp. 202-207); he has been called a pedophile by cynics, while in my opinion he was essentially a one-woman-man! (pp. 85-89). REVIEWS “I have been an avid reader of Islamic literature for several years, but never came across such a fascinating book. It will delight students, teachers, imams and academicians alike. ...The book is an eye-opener, a must-read.” Moin Qazi THE ASIAN AGE 27 October 2017 “…It is a must read for believers and for those with stakes in a just and peaceful world.” Zakia Soman www.thecitizen.in 11 October 2017“Sanjiv Bhatla’s book is a …very necessary mirror to Muslims so that they wake up, realize where they have gone wrong…” Nigar Ataulla ISLAMIC VOICE October 2017"

Her journey is as lyrical and complicated as the sky she describes, and her book is a shimmering parting gift to those still earthbound Source: GuardianSkybound is a soaring gift of a book. A moving meditation on landscapes and the leaving of them, the freedom of travelling beyond our fears and how our journeys between the known and the unknown, the familiar and the unfamiliar can teach us to cherish and see again. Author: Owen SheersIt's early for predictions, but I'm sure Rebecca Loncraine's Skybound is going to be one of my books of the year. It's a book that makes you look at the sky and the land with new eyes; that gives you a lift, in more ways than one . . . an extraordinary book . . . a celebration of wind and wings . . . we've lost a huge talent Source: Daily TelegraphStunning.

I won't soon forget her meditations on fear and flight, on home and family . . . 'Learning to fly,' she wrote, 'is like asking the universe . . . to let me go into the world to live and soar with joy and the possibility of death.'

It is an astonishingly beautiful book, a record of a life that, although heartbreakingly short, was lived vividly and thrillingly and intensely. We must all strive to do what Rebecca undoubtedly did - honour the miracle of our existence. She has left the world with something brilliant and unique. Author: Niall Griffiths, author of GritsAs thoughtful and insightful as it is courageous and inspiring Source: Sunday ExpressAs much a biography of the air as it is a deeply moving memoir, this beautiful book transformed the way I see the sky. I learnt so much about how the air behaves, the physics of gliding. And Loncraine’s affinity for the birds she observes and flies with shines through this fascinating, lovely book Author: James Macdonald Lockhart, author of RaptorSkybound is a profound and exquisitely written witness to the author's flight and fear, wings and woundedness.

Books,"Beartown: A Novel Review PRAISE FOR BEARTOWN  “Backman is a masterful writer, his characters familiar yet distinct, flawed yet heroic. . . There are scenes that bring tears, scenes of gut-wrenching despair, and moments of sly humor. . .Like Friday Night Lights, this is about more than youth sports; it's part coming-of-age novel, part study of moral failure, and finally a chronicle of groupthink in which an unlikely hero steps forward to save more than one person from self-destruction. A thoroughly empathetic examination of the fragile human spirit, Backman's latest will resonate a long time.” (Kirkus Reviews)“[It's] Backman’s rich characters that steal the show, and his deft handling of tragedy and its effects on an insular town.  While the story is dark at times, love, sacrifice, and the bonds of friendship and family shine through ultimately offering hope and even redemption.” (Publishers Weekly)""Another solid offering from best-selling Swedish author Backman, with many parallels for American readers and small towns everywhere."" (Library Journal)""The sentimentally savvy Backman (A Man Called Ove, 2014) takes a sobering and solemn look at the ways alienation and acceptance, ethics and emotions nearly destroy a small town and young people."" (Booklist)""[A] slow burn of a novel about a community that pours all its hopes into a youth hockey team. Think Friday Night Lights for Swedes."" (O, The Oprah Magazine)""As popular Swedish exports go, Backman is up there with Abba and Stieg Larssson."" (The New York Times Book Review)""Backman is the Dickens of our age, and though you'll cry, your heart is safe in his hands."" (Green Valley News (Arizona))“There are, in the end, real acts of bravery and sacrifice in this appealing novel.” (Wall Street Journal)“Mr. Backman cements his standing as a writer of astonishing depth and proves that he also has very broad range plus the remarkable ability to make you understand the feelings of each of a dozen different characters. . . . The story is fully packed with wise insights into the human experience causing characters and readers to ponder life’s great question of who we are, what we hope to be and how we should lead our lives.” (The Washington Times)“This novel was well worth reading, and I embrace what I learned from it.” (The Missourian) 				    	 					 About the Author Fredrik Backman is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Man Called Ove (soon to be a major motion picture starring Tom Hanks), My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry, Britt-Marie Was Here, Beartown, Us Against You, as well as two novellas, And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer and The Deal of a Lifetime.

Books,"How to Win Friends and Influence People (DELUXE EDITION) About the Author Dale Carnegie (1888–1955) was an American writer and lecturer and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking and interpersonal skills.He was born in an impoverished family in Maryville, Missouri. Carnegie harboured a strong love and passion for public speaking from a very early age and was very proactive in debate in high school. During the early 1930’s, he was renowned and very famous for his books and a radio program. 'When How to Win Friends and Influence People' was published in 1930, it became an instant success and subsequently became one of the biggest bestsellers of all time.Carnegie loved teaching others to climb the pillars of success. His valuable and tested advice was used in many domains and has been the inspiration of many famous people’s success. One of the core ideas in his books is that it is possible to change other people's behaviour by changing one's reaction to them."
Books,"How To Win Friends And Influence People Amazon.com Review This grandfather of all people-skills books was first published in 1937. It was an overnight hit, eventually selling 15 million copies. How to Win Friends and Influence People is just as useful today as it was when it was first published, because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to ""the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people."" He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person's point of view and ""arousing in the other person an eager want."" You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, ""let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers,"" and ""talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person."" Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. --Joan Price  About the Author Dale Carnegie (1888-1955) described himself as a ""simple country boy"" from Missouri but was also a pioneer of the self-improvement genre. Since the 1936 publication of his first book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, he has touched millions of readers and his classic works continue to impact lives to this day.

Books,"Thinking, Fast and Slow Review A New York Times Book Review Best BookA Globe and Mail Best Book“I will never think about thinking quite the same. [Thinking, Fast and Slow] is a monumental achievement.”—Roger Lowenstein, Bloomberg/Businessweek“Profound . . . As Copernicus removed the Earth from the centre of the universe and Darwin knocked humans off their biological perch, Mr. Kahneman has shown that we are not the paragons of reason we assume ourselves to be.” —The Economist “[Kahneman’s] disarmingly simple experiments have profoundly changed the way that we think about thinking . . . We like to see ourselves as a Promethean species, uniquely endowed with the gift of reason. But Mr. Kahneman’s simple experiments reveal a very different mind, stuffed full of habits that, in most situations, lead us astray.” —Jonah Lehrer, The Wall Street Journal “[A] tour de force of psychological insight, research explication and compelling narrative that brings together in one volume the high points of Mr. Kahneman's notable contributions, over five decades, to the study of human judgment, decision-making and choice . . . Thanks to the elegance and force of his ideas, and the robustness of the evidence he offers for them, he has helped us to a new understanding of our divided minds—and our whole selves.” —Christoper F. Chabris, The Wall Street Journal “The ramifications of Kahenman’s work are wide, extending into education, business, marketing, politics . . . and even happiness research. Call his field “psychonomics,” the hidden reasoning behind our choices. Thinking, Fast and Slow is essential reading for anyone with a mind.” —Kyle Smith, The New York Post “A major intellectual event . . . The work of Kahneman and Tversky was a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves.” —David Brooks, The New York Times; Author of The Social Animal “Kahneman provides a detailed, yet accessible, description of the psychological mechanisms involved in making decisions.” —Jacek Debiec, Nature “With Kahneman’s expert help, readers may understand this mix of psychology and economics better than most accountants, therapists, or elected representatives. VERDICT: A stellar accomplishment, a book for everyone who likes to think and wants to do it better.” —Library Journal“Kahneman’s extraordinary contribution to humanity’s cerebral growth [has] reached the mainstream—in the best way possible.” —The Atlantic “Thinking, Fast and Slow is a magisterial work, stunning in its ambition, infused with knowledge, laced with wisdom, informed by modesty and deeply humane. If you can read only one book this year, read this one.” —The Globe and Mail “[In Thinking, Fast and Slow] We learn why we mistake statistical noise for coherent patterns; why the stock-picking of well-paid investment advisers and the prognostications of pundits are worthless; why businessmen tend to be both absurdly overconfident and unwisely risk-averse; and why memory affects decision making in counterintuitive ways. Kahneman's primer adds to recent challenges to economic orthodoxies about rational actors and efficient markets; more than that, it's a lucid, marvelously readable guide to spotting--and correcting--our biased misunderstandings of the world.” —Publishers' Weekly (starred review)“For anyone interested in economics, cognitive science, psychology, and, in short, human behavior, this is the book of the year. Before Malcolm Gladwell and Freakonomics, there was Daniel Kahneman who invented the field of behavior economics, won a Nobel…and now explains how we think and make choices. Here’s an easy choice: read this.” —The Daily Beast“The author of several scholarly texts, Kahneman now offers general readers not just the findings of psychological research but also a better understanding of how research questions arise and how scholars systematically frame and answer them. . . . Gripping. Striking research showing the immense complexity of ordinary thought and revealing the identities of the gatekeepers in our minds.” —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)“Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow deals with the very nature of thought, and it just may be the most important book I’ve read in many years. . .” —Los Angeles Review of Books“This book is one of the few that must be counted as mandatory reading for anyone interested in the Internet, even though it doesn’t claim to be about that. Before computer networking got cheap and ubiquitous, the sheer inefficiency of communication dampened the effects of the quirks of human psychology on macro scale events. No more. We must now confront how we really are in order to make sense of our world and not screw it up. Daniel Kahneman has discovered a path to make it possible.” —Jaron Lanier, author of You Are Not a Gadget“Daniel Kahneman is one of the most original and interesting thinkers of our time. There may be no other person on the planet who better understands how and why we make the choices we make. In this absolutely amazing book, he shares a lifetime’s worth of wisdom presented in a manner that is simple and engaging, but nonetheless stunningly profound. This book is a must read for anyone with a curious mind.” —Steven D. Levitt, William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago; co-author of Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics.“Thinking, Fast and Slow is a masterpiece—a brilliant and engaging intellectual saga by one of the greatest psychologists and deepest thinkers of our time. Kahneman should be parking a Pulitzer next to his Nobel Prize.” —Daniel Gilbert, Harvard University Professor of Psychology, author of Stumbling on Happiness, host of the award-winning PBS television series “This Emotional Life” “This book is a tour de force by an intellectual giant; it is readable, wise, and deep. Buy it fast. Read it slowly and repeatedly. It will change the way you think, on the job, about the world, and in your own life.” —Richard Thaler, University of Chicago Professor of Economics and co-author of Nudge“This is a landmark book in social thought, in the same league as The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith and The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud.”—Nassim Taleb, author of The Black Swan“Daniel Kahneman is among the most influential psychologists in history and certainly the most important psychologist alive today. He has a gift for uncovering remarkable features of the human mind, many of which have become textbook classics and part of the conventional wisdom. His work has reshaped social psychology, cognitive science, the study of reason and of happiness, and behavioral economics, a field that he and his collaborator Amos Tversky helped to launch. The appearance of Thinking, Fast and Slow is a major event.” —Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of How the Mind Works and The Better Angels of our Nature  About the Author DANIEL KAHNEMAN is Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Princeton University and a professor of public affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He is the only non-economist to have won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences; it was awarded to him in 2002 for his pioneering work with Amos Tversky on decision-making."

The subprime disaster? How about mad cow disease? Each new crisis makes us worry until we forget and start worrying about the next one. Many of us found ourselves stranded in crowded airports, ruined by vanishing pension funds, or anxious about tucking into a yummy beef steak. When something goes wrong, we are told that the way to prevent further crisis is better technology, more laws, and bigger bureaucracy. How to protect ourselves from the next financial crisis? Stricter regulations, more and better advisers. How to protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism? Homeland security, full body scanners, further sacrifice of individual freedom. How to counteract exploding costs in health care? Tax hikes, rationalization, better genetic markers.One idea is absent from these lists: risk-savvy citizens. And there is a reason.“Human beings are fallible: lazy, stupid, greedy and weak,” an article in the Economist announced.1 We are said to be irrational slaves to our whims and appetites, addicted to sex, smoking, and electronic gadgets. Twenty-year-olds drive with their cell phones glued to their ears, oblivious to the fact that doing so lowers their reaction time to that of a seventy-year-old. A fifth of Americans believe that they are in the top 1 percent income group and just as many believe that they will soon be there. Bankers have little respect for people’s ability to invest money, and some doctors tell me that most of their patients lack intelligence, making it pointless to disclose health information that might be misunderstood in the first place. All of this points to the conclusion that Homo sapiens (“man the wise”) is a misnomer. Something has gone wrong in our genes. Evolution seems to have cheated us with shabby mental software and miswired our brains. In short, John and Jane Q. Public need continuous guidance, as a child needs a parent. Although we live in the high-tech twenty-first century, some form of paternalism is the only viable strategy: Close the doors, collect the experts, and tell the public what’s best for them.This fatalistic message is not what you will read in this book.2 The problem is not simply individual stupidity, but the phenomenon of a risk-illiterate society.Literacy—the ability to read and write—is the lifeblood of an informed citizenship in a democracy. But knowing how to read and write isn’t enough. Risk literacy is the basic knowledge required to deal with a modern technological society. The breakneck speed of technological innovation will make risk literacy as indispensable in the twenty-first century as reading and writing were in previous centuries. Without it, you jeopardize your health and money, or may be manipulated into unrealistic fears and hopes. One might think that the basics of risk literacy are already being taught. Yet you will look in vain for it in most high schools, law schools, medical schools, and beyond. As a result, most of us are risk illiterate.When I use the general term risk savvy I refer not just to risk literacy, but also more broadly to situations where not all risks are known and calculable. Risk savvy is not the same as risk aversion. Without taking risks, innovation would end, as would fun, and courage would belong to the past. Nor does risk savvy mean turning into a reckless daredevil or BASE jumper, denying the possibility of landing on one’s nose. Without a beneficial degree of caution, humans would have ceased to exist long ago.You might think, why bother if there are experts to consult? But it isn’t that simple. Bitter experience teaches that expert advice may be a dangerous thing. Many doctors, financial advisers, and other risk experts themselves misunderstand risks or are unable to communicate them in an understandable way. Worse, quite a few have conflicts of interest or are so afraid of litigation that they recommend actions to clients they would never recommend to their own families. You have no choice but to think for yourself.I’d like to invite you into the world of uncertainty and risk, beginning with weather reports and a very humble hazard, getting soaked.Chances of RainA weathercaster on U.S. television once announced the weather this way:The probability that it will rain on Saturday is 50 percent. The chance that it will rain on Sunday is also 50 percent. Therefore, the probability that it will rain on the weekend is 100 percent.Most of us will smile at this.3 But do you know what it means when the weather report announces a 30 percent chance of rain tomorrow? 30 percent of what? I live in Berlin. Most Berliners believe that it will rain tomorrow 30 percent of the time; that is, for seven to eight hours. Others think that it will rain in 30 percent of the region; that is, most likely not where they live. Most New Yorkers think both are nonsense. They believe that it will rain on 30 percent of the days for which this announcement is made; that is, there will most likely be no rain at all tomorrow.4Are people hopelessly confused? Not necessarily. Part of the problem is the experts who never learned how to explain probabilities in the first place. If they clearly stated the class to which a chance of rain refers, the confusion would disappear. Time? Region? Days? What meteorologists intend to say is that it will rain on 30 percent of the days for which this prediction is made. And “rain” refers to any amount above some tiny threshold, such as 0.01 inches.5 Left on their own, people intuitively fill in a reference class that makes sense to them, such as how many hours, where, or how heavily it rains. More imaginative minds will come up with others still. As one woman in New York said, “I know what 30 percent means: Three meteorologists think it will rain, and seven not.”Here is my point. New forecasting technology has enabled meteorologists to replace mere verbal statements of certainty (“it will rain tomorrow”) or chance (“it is likely”) with numerical precision. But greater precision has not led to greater understanding of what the message really is. The confusion over probabilities of rain has persisted in fact since the very first time they were broadcast to the public in 1965 in the United States. This confusion is not just limited to rain, but occurs whenever a probability is attached to a single event—such as “if you take an antidepressant, you have a 30 percent chance of developing a sexual problem.” Does that mean that 30 percent of all people will develop a sexual problem, or that you yourself will have a problem in 30 percent of your sexual encounters? The solution to clearing this widespread and long-standing muddle is surprisingly simple:Always ask for the reference class: Percent of what?If weathercasters were taught how to communicate to the public, you wouldn’t even have to ask.Getting soaked is a minor risk, although for some, from the farmer to Ferrari, the chances of rain matter. Before the Formula 1 Grand Prix, one of the most-discussed issues is the weather forecast—choosing the right tires are the key to winning the race. The same holds for NASA: The weather forecast is essential for approving or canceling a space shuttle launch, as the Challenger disaster tragically illustrates. Yet for most of us, all that is at stake is canceling a family outing unnecessarily or getting wet feet. People may not make a special effort to understand chances of rain simply because the hazards are modest. Are we more risk savvy when something truly important is at stake?Figure 1-1. What does a “30 percent chance of rain tomorrow” mean? Some believe it will rain tomorrow 30 percent of the time (upper panel). Others believe it will rain tomorrow in 30 percent of the region (middle panel). Finally, some believe that three meteorologists think that it will rain and seven do not (lower panel). What meteorologists in fact intend to say is something different: that it will rain on 30 percent of the days for which this announcement is made. The problem is not simply in people’s minds, but in the failure of experts to state clearly what they mean.Pill ScareGreat Britain has many traditions, one of them being the contraceptive pill scare. Since the early 1960s, women are alarmed every couple of years by reports that the pill can lead to thrombosis, potentially life-threatening blood clots in the legs or lungs. In the most famous scare, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines issued a warning that third-generation oral contraceptive pills increased the risk of thrombosis twofold—that is, by 100 percent. How much more certain can you get? This terrifying information was passed on in “Dear Doctor” letters to 190,000 general practitioners, pharmacists, and directors of public health and was presented in an emergency announcement to the media. Alarm bells rang around the country. Distressed women stopped taking the pill, which caused unwanted pregnancies and abortions.6Just how big is 100 percent? The studies on which the warning was based had shown that of every seven thousand women who took the earlier, second-generation pill, about one had a thrombosis; and that this number increased to two among women who took third-generation pills. That is, the absolute risk increase was only one in seven thousand, whereas the relative risk increase was indeed 100 percent. As we see, in contrast to absolute risks, relative risks appear threateningly large and can cause a great stir. Had the committee and the media reported the absolute risks, few women would have panicked and dropped the pill. Most likely, no one would have even cared.This single scare led to an estimated thirteen thousand (!) additional abortions in the following year in England and Wales. But the fallout lasted for longer than one year. Before the alert, abortion rates had been steeply on the decline, but afterward, this trend was reversed and abortion rates increased for years to come. Women’s confidence in oral contraceptives was undermined, and pill sales fell sharply. Not all unwanted pregnancies were aborted; for every abortion there was also one extra birth. The increase in both abortions and births was particularly pronounced among girls under sixteen, with some eight hundred additional conceptions.Ironically, pregnancies and abortions are associated with a risk of thrombosis that exceeds that of the third-generation pill. The pill scare hurt women, hurt the National Health Service, and even brought down the stocks of the pharmaceutical industry. The resulting increase in costs to the National Health Service for abortion provision has been estimated at £4–6 million. Among the few who profited were the journalists who got the story on the front page.An unwanted pregnancy and abortion is not something to be taken lightly. As one woman reports:When I learned that I was pregnant, my partner and I were together for two years. His first reaction was: “Come back when it’s gone.” I threw him out and tried to find a solution. I wanted so much to begin with college. I fought for building a future for us, but I began to realize there was none. The one thing I did not want was to become dependent on the government, or—even worse—on a man. Therefore I decided last minute for an abortion. It’s now two days ago, and I have one nervous breakdown after the other. My mind says, it was the best decision, but my heart weeps.The tradition of pill scares continues to the present day, and always with the same trick. The solution is not better pills or more sophisticated abortion technology, but risk-savvy young women and men. It would not be so difficult to explain to teenagers the simple distinction between a relative risk (“100 percent”) and an absolute risk (“one in seven thousand”). After all, batting averages and other sports statistics are common knowledge for many, young and old. Yet to the present day journalists have succeeded in causing scares with BIG numbers, and the public predictably panics, year after year.Once again, the remedy is a simple rule:Always ask: What is the absolute risk increase?Journalists are not the only ones who play on our emotions with the help of numbers. Top medical journals, health brochures, and the Internet also inform the public in terms of relative changes, because bigger numbers make better headlines. In 2009 the prestigious British Medical Journal published two articles on oral contraceptives and thrombosis: One made the absolute numbers transparent in its abstract, while the other again touted relative risks, reporting that “oral contraceptives increased the risk of venous thrombosis fivefold.”7 The “fivefold” increase of course made for more spectacular headlines, and some newspapers, such as the London Evening Standard, didn’t even bother mentioning the absolute numbers. As a rule, although we have high-tech medicine, understandable information for patients and doctors remains the exception.It should be the ethical responsibility of every editor to enforce transparent reporting and it should be on the agenda of every ethics committee and every department of health. But it is not. After publication of my book Calculated Risks, which explains how to help both the public and doctors understand numbers, the neuroscientist Mike Gazzaniga, then dean of the faculty at Dartmouth College, paid me a visit. Outraged by the tricks played on the public by the use of relative risks and other means, he said that he would propose this issue to the President’s Council on Bioethics, of which he was a member. After all, he argued, misleading the public with numbers happens in the United States just as often as in the United Kingdom, and is one of the few ethical problems to which a solution is known. Other less clear-cut issues, such as abortion, stem cells, and genetic testing, tend to occupy the council with endless discussions. I am grateful to Gazzaniga for trying. Yet the ethics committee did not recognize misleading the public as a significant issue and never took it up.If ethics committees don’t protect people, why don’t doctors do it? The surprising answer is that many doctors themselves don’t know how to communicate risks, a skill rarely taught at medical schools. The damaging effect of the “Dear Doctor” letters illustrates that many of them were taken in by relative risks. Once again, the experts are in need of training. Otherwise, when the next pill scare arrives, they and those affected may be as unprepared as ever.I have explained the difference between relative and absolute risks to hundreds of journalists, and many have stopped alarming the public and reported absolute risks—only to see their editors often reintroduce the BIG numbers. We may not always be able to halt those who like to play with our fears, but we can learn to see through their tricks.Terrorists Use Our BrainsMost of us remember exactly where we were on September 11, 2001. The pictures of the planes crashing into the twin towers of the World Trade Center have been ingrained into our memories. In the meantime, everything appears to have been said about the tragic attack. The 9/11 Commission Report, which appeared three years later, focused on how al-Qaeda terrorism evolved and on diplomatic strategies, legal reform, and technological measures. The one measure the 636-page report did not pay attention to, however, was risk-savvy citizens.Let us turn the clock back to December 2001. Imagine you live in New York and want to travel to Washington. Would you fly or drive?We know that after the attack, many Americans stopped flying. Did they stay home or jump into their cars? I have looked for an answer in the transportation statistics. In the months after the attack, the miles driven increased substantially. The increase was particularly strong on the rural interstate highways where long-distance travel happens, jumping by as much as 5 percent in the three months after the attack.8 For comparison, in the months before the assault (January to August), individual monthly vehicle miles were up only less than 1 percent compared to 2000, which reflects the normal increase from year to year. All this extra driving lasted for twelve months; thereafter, car driving went back to normal. By then the images of the burning twin towers were no longer a daily feature in the media.The increase in road travel had sobering consequences. Before the attack, the number of fatal traffic accidents remained closely around the average of the previous five years (the zero line in Figure 1-2). Yet in each of the twelve months after 9/11, the number of fatal crashes was above average, and most of the time, even higher than anything that happened in the previous five years. All in all, an estimated sixteen hundred Americans lost their lives on the road due to their decision to avoid the risk of flying.Figure 1-2. Terrorists’ second strike. After the attacks on September 11, 2001, the number of fatal traffic accidents increased in the United States for a period of twelve months, resulting in an estimated sixteen hundred Americans losing their lives on the road in the attempt to avoid the risk of flying. Numbers are expressed as deviations from the five-year baseline 1996–2000 (the zero line). Before September 2001, the monthly fatal crashes were close to the zero line. In the twelve months following the attack, the number of fatal crashes was higher than the zero line for every month, and in most cases exceeded the maximum of the previous years (the vertical bars show the maximum and minimum). The peaks after 9/11 correspond to terrorism alerts.Source: Gigerenzer (2004, 2006).This death toll is six times higher than the total number of passengers (256) who died on board the four fatal flights. Every one of those traffic victims might still be alive if they had flown instead. From 2002 to 2005, 2.5 billion passengers took to the air on U.S. commercial flights. Not a single one died in a major airline crash. Thus, although the 9/11 attacks were reported to have cost the lives of about three thousand Americans, the number is at least half as many more.Let’s give the statistic a face, but a lucky one—one who barely escaped death.Justin Klabin, a twenty-six-year-old competitive rugby player and volunteer firefighter, watched the twin towers collapse from across the Hudson River. With his fire department, he rushed to Ground Zero. After this deeply emotional experience, he decided to stop flying. A month later, he and his girlfriend went on a trip to Florida—by car. Their pickup truck mastered the thousand-mile distance. But at the end of a long day on the road back home, they heard a loud pop: Both front tires turned toward each other, like snowplowing skis. The tie-rod that connected the steering column to the wheel had snapped, and the truck could not drive a foot farther. They were lucky that the disaster happened when they pulled into a parking space in South Carolina. Had the rod snapped minutes earlier on the highway at a speed of seventy miles per hour, it is likely that Klabin and his girlfriend would have joined those unfortunate travelers who lost their lives by avoiding the risk of flying.Terrorists strike twice. First they assault with physical force, and then they assault us with the help of our brains. The first strike gains all the attention. Billions of dollars have been poured into developing gigantic bureaucracies, including Homeland Security, and new technologies, such as full body scanners that make visible the nude surface of skin beneath clothing. The second strike, in contrast, has received almost no attention. In fact, when I gave talks on risk management to international intelligence services and counterterrorism agencies across the world, from Singapore to Wiesbaden, my hosts were repeatedly surprised, having never even considered it. Osama bin Laden once explained with relish how little money he used to cause such huge damages: “Al-Qaeda spent $500,000 on the event, while America, in the incident and its aftermath, lost—according to the lowest estimate—more than $500 billion, meaning that every dollar of al-Qaeda defeated a million dollars.”9 It’s hard to prevent terrorists’ suicide missions, but it should be easier to put a stop to the dangerous reactions based on fears that their attacks create within us in their aftermath.What exactly is our brain’s psychology that terrorists exploit? Low-probability events in which many people are suddenly killed, so-called dread risks,10 trigger an unconscious psychological principle:If many people die at one point in time, react with fear and avoid that situation.Note that the fear is not about dying per se. It is about dying in a specific manner, namely together at one point in time, or in a short interval. When many die spectacularly at one point in time, as in the 9/11 attacks, our evolved brain reacts with great anxiety. But when as many or more die distributed over time, such as in car and motorbike accidents, we are less likely to be afraid. In the United States alone, where about 35,000 people die on the road every year, few worry about dying while driving. What matters psychologically is not, as sometimes claimed, that people have control when driving but not when flying. Passengers sitting next to the driver, not to speak of those in the back seats, have no control either, yet show little fear. We don’t really fear dying in the steady stream of everyday incidents; we fear dying together suddenly with lots of others. We dread the rare nuclear power plant accident, not the steady death toll caused by pollution from coal power plants. We dreaded the swine flu pandemic after hearing the forecast of possibly tens of thousands of deaths—which never occurred—while few worry about being among the actual tens of thousands of people killed every year by the regular flu.Where does this tendency to fear dread risks come from? In human history, it was likely a rational response. For most of our evolution, humans lived in small hunter-gatherer bands that may have consisted of up to twenty to fifty individuals and rarely exceeded one hundred people, similar to such bands in the world today. In small bands, the sudden loss of many lives could increase the risk of predation and starvation, and thus threaten survival of the whole group.11 But what was rational in the past is not rational today. In modern societies, an individual’s survival is no longer dependent on the support and protection of a small group or tribe. Yet the psychological response can still be easily elicited. To this day, real or imagined catastrophes have the potential to trigger panicky reactions.The “old-brain” fear of dread risks can suppress any flash of thought in the new parts of our brains. As a professor from Loyola University Chicago wrote to me, “After 9/11, I explained the greater risk of driving compared to flying to my wife; that did not do the trick.” Rational argument does not always win over old-brain fear, particularly if one spouse tries to educate the other. Yet there is a simple rule of thumb that could have helped that professor:If reason conflicts with a strong emotion, don’t try to argue. Enlist a conflicting and stronger emotion.One such emotion that conflicts with dread-risk fear is parental concern. The professor might remind his wife that by making them drive long distances she puts the lives of her children—not just that of her husband—at risk. Parental emotions stand a better chance of overcoming the lingering fear of flying. A smart “new brain” can play one evolved fear against another to better survive in a modern world. Evolution is not destiny.Terrorists’ second strike goes beyond the story told here. It has led to an erosion of civil liberties: Before 9/11, strip searches without probable cause were seen to violate human rights; they are now seen as citizens’ duty. Dread-risk fear makes us willing to tolerate long lines at the airport, put liquids in plastic bags, remove our shoes and belts and jackets, have our bodies touched by strangers. Higher security expenses in turn have gone hand in hand with reduced service and cramped seating, as if the airlines were competing for the worst customer service. People have become less lighthearted and more fearful. Last but not least, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost more than a trillion dollars together with the lives of thousands of soldiers and many more civilians. This financial strain also likely played a part in the financial crisis of 2008.12If a similar attack ever repeats itself, we should not let our brains be misused again for a second strike. Only when we are risk savvy can we resist terrorist manipulation and create a safer and more resilient society. To get there, three tools are essential: understanding the nature of dread-risk fear, controlling it by enlisting conflicting emotions if reasons don’t work, and knowing the actual risk of flying.Let’s go back to the question I posed before: Should you fly or drive? Assume again you live in New York and want to travel to Washington. You have only one goal, to arrive alive. How many miles would you have to drive by car until the risk of dying is the same as in a nonstop flight? I have asked this to dozens of expert audiences. The answers are all over the place: one thousand miles, ten thousand miles, driving three times around the world. However, the best estimate is twelve miles. Yes, only twelve. If your car makes it safely to the airport, the most dangerous part of your trip is likely already behind you.Are People Hopeless in Dealing with Risk?How can so many people not notice that they don’t understand probabilities of rain? Or end up with unwanted pregnancies and abortions because they don’t know the difference between relative and absolute risks? After all, probabilities of rain and pill scares have been around since the mid-1960s, and the fear of dread risks repeats itself with every new threat, from mad cow disease to SARS to bird flu, in an apparently endless circle. Why don’t people learn?Many experts think the answer is that people are basically incapable of understanding such things. Attempts to educate people out of their errors, so the argument goes, have mostly failed. Based on this dismal view of the general public, a publication by Deutsche Bank Research features a list of errors that we “Homer Simpsons” commit against rationality.13 Popular books rehearse this message, portraying Homo sapiens as “predictably irrational” and in need of “nudges” into behaving sensibly by the few sane people on earth.14My story is different. People aren’t stupid. The problem is that our educational system has an amazing blind spot concerning risk literacy. We teach our children the mathematics of certainty—geometry and trigonometry—but not the mathematics of uncertainty, statistical thinking. And we teach our children biology but not the psychology that shapes their fears and desires. Even experts, shockingly, are not trained how to communicate risks to the public in an understandable way. And there can be positive interest in scaring people: to get an article on the front page, to persuade people to relinquish civil rights, or to sell a product. All these outside causes contribute to the problem.The good news is that there is a solution. Who would have thought, a few hundred years ago, that so many people on earth would learn to read and write? We will see that everybody who wants to can also become risk savvy. Based on my and other colleagues’ research, I will argue that:1. Everyone can learn to deal with risk and uncertainty. In this book, I will explain principles that are easily understood by everyone who dares to know.2. Experts are part of the problem rather than the solution. Many experts themselves struggle with understanding risks, lack skills in communicating them, and pursue interests not aligned with yours. Giant banks go bust for exactly these reasons. Little is gained when risk-illiterate authorities are placed in charge of guiding the public.3. Less is more. When we face a complex problem, we look for a complex solution. And when it doesn’t work, we seek an even more complex one. In an uncertain world, that’s a big error. Complex problems do not always require complex solutions. Overly complicated systems, from financial derivatives to tax systems, are difficult to comprehend, easy to exploit, and possibly dangerous. And they do not increase the trust of the people. Simple rules, in contrast, can make us smart and create a safer world.“Savvy” means acute, astute, and wise. But being risk savvy is more than being well informed. It requires courage to face an uncertain future as well as to stand up to authority and ask critical questions. We can take the remote control for our emotions back into our own hands. Using one’s mind without another’s guidance entails an inner psychological revolution. Such a revolt makes life more enlightening and less anxiety-ridden. I have written this book to encourage risk-savvy citizens.Becoming Risk SavvyIn his essay “What Is Enlightenment?” the philosopher Immanuel Kant begins thus:15Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know!Freedom of speech, the right to vote, and protection against harm are among the most important achievements since the Enlightenment. These liberties are a treasure. They refer to what doors are open to you, to your opportunities. Today, every Internet user has free access to more information than humankind ever had before. Yet the idea of open doors is a passive or “negative” concept of liberty. Positive liberty, in contrast, entails more than free access. The question is whether you are able to walk through these doors, whether you can master your life without the constant guidance of others.16 Now that people in democratic societies have vastly enlarged their opportunities, positive liberty has become the next challenge.Risk-savvy citizens are indispensable pillars of a society that is ready for positive liberty. Whether the context is a weather forecast, a medical decision, or a large-scale disaster, being risk savvy requires a basic knowledge of our intuitive psychology as well as an understanding of statistical information. Only with both skills, and a portion of curiosity and courage, will we be able to take our lives in our own hands. 2Certainty Is an IllusionNothing will ever separate us. We will probably be married another ten years.Elizabeth Taylor, 1974, five days before she and Richard Burton announced their divorceWe think of uncertainty as something we don’t want. In the best of all worlds, all things should be certain, absolutely certain. So we buy insurance against everything, swear by horoscopes, or pray to God. We collect terabytes of information to turn our computers into crystal balls. Yet think of what would happen if our wishes were granted. If we knew everything about the future with certainty, our lives would be drained of emotion. No surprise and pleasure, no joy or thrill—we knew it all along. The first kiss, the first proposal, the birth of a healthy child would be about as exciting as last year’s weather report. If our world ever turned certain, life would be mind-numbingly dull.The Illusion of CertaintyNonetheless many of us ask for certainty from our bankers, our doctors, and our political leaders. What they deliver in response is the illusion of certainty, the belief that something is certain even when it isn’t. Every year we support a multibillion-dollar industry that calculates future predictions, mostly erroneous, from market tips to global flu pandemics. Many of us smile at old-fashioned fortune-tellers. But when the soothsayers work with computer algorithms rather than tarot cards, we take their predictions seriously and are prepared to pay for them. The most astounding part is our collective amnesia: Most of us are still anxious to see stock market predictions even if they have been consistently wrong year after year.Throughout history, humans have created belief systems that promise certainty, such as astrology and divination. A glance on the Internet reveals that these systems are still in high demand. Modern technology has added further vehicles of apparent certainty, from genetic tests to personalized medicine to risk measures in banking.Blind Faith in TestsIf a genetic test shows that the defendant’s DNA matches with the traces found on the murdered victim, isn’t this certain evidence that he is the murderer? If a woman who is pregnant takes an HIV test and the test comes out positive, isn’t this certain evidence that she—and likely her baby—is infected? In a word, no. To find out how widespread the illusion of certainty actually is, I surveyed a representative sample of one thousand German adults. They were asked in face-to-face interviews: “Which of the following tests are absolutely certain?” The result is shown in Figure 2-1.Figure 2-1. Which test is absolutely certain? Among a representative sample of one thousand Germans, 4 percent believed that an expert horoscope is absolutely certain. When modern technology is involved, the illusion of certainty is amplified. All of these tests make errors.When an astrologer calculates an expert horoscope for you and foretells that you will develop a serious illness and might even die at age forty-nine, will you tremble when the date approaches? Some 4 percent of Germans would; they believe that an expert horoscope is absolutely certain.1 Yet there is no evidence that horoscopes do better than a good friend asked to predict your future. But when technology is involved, the illusion of certainty is amplified. Forty-four percent of people surveyed think that the result of a screening mammogram is certain. In fact, mammograms fail to detect about ten percent of cancers, and the younger the women being tested, the more error-prone the results, because their breasts are denser.Finally, nearly two thirds of Germans believe that HIV tests and fingerprints are absolutely certain, and an even higher number place their faith in DNA tests. These tests are indeed much more accurate than mammograms, but none of their results are certain. Fingerprints, for instance, are unique features of an individual, even for identical twins who share the same genes. If the fingerprints of a suspect matched with those found on the scene of a crime, what jury would acquit the suspect? But is our system for fingerprint identification infallible? Fingerprints were believed to be “foolproof” until 1998, when the FBI sent two fingerprints found on a getaway car to be matched with the fingerprints of the convicted perpetrator to labs at several U.S. state law enforcement agencies. From thirty-five laboratories, eight could not match one of the prints and six more found no match for the other.2 Clearly, this is not the exact science many believe it to be.Not understanding a new technology is one thing. Believing that it delivers certainty is another. For those of us who suffer from the illusion of certainty, there is a simple remedy. Always remember what Benjamin Franklin said:“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.”My Security Blanket, PleaseHumans appear to have a need for certainty, a motivation to hold on to something rather than to question it. People with a high need for certainty are more prone to stereotypes than others and are less inclined to remember information that contradicts their stereotypes.3 They find ambiguity confusing and have a desire to plan out their lives rationally. First get a degree, a car, and then a career, find the most perfect partner, buy a home, and have beautiful babies. But then the economy breaks down, the job is lost, the partner has an affair with someone else, and one finds oneself packing boxes to move to a cheaper place. In an uncertain world, we cannot plan everything ahead. Here, we can only cross each bridge when we come to it, not beforehand. The very desire to plan and organize everything may be part of the problem, not the solution. There is a Yiddish joke: “Do you know how to make God laugh? Tell him your plans.”To be sure, illusions have their function. Small children often need security blankets to soothe their fears. Yet for the mature adult, a high need for certainty can be a dangerous thing. It prevents us from learning to face the uncertainty pervading our lives. As hard as we try, we cannot make our lives risk-free the way we make our milk fat-free.At the same time, a psychological need is not entirely to blame for the illusion of certainty. Manufacturers of certainty play a crucial role in cultivating the illusion. They delude us into thinking that our future is predictable, as long as the right technology is at hand. Yet the future can be one damned thing after another. False certainty is disseminated by many an expert, and sometimes shamelessly. “I am sure I have found the Holy Grail,” a financial expert divulged to an eager-looking client at a fancy Zurich hotel in such a bellowing baritone that I could not help but listen. After an hour of plugging a supposedly fail-safe investment without a waver of a doubt, he won over the client—and his money.The quest for certainty is an old human endeavor. Magical cults, soothsayers, and authority figures who know what’s right and wrong are its proponents. Similarly, for centuries many philosophers have been misled by looking for certainties where none exist, equating knowledge with certainty and belief with uncertainty, as John Dewey, the great pragmatist philosopher, pointed out.4 Today, modern technologies, from mathematical stock prediction methods to medical imaging machines, compete for the confidence promised by religion and authority.The quest for certainty is the biggest obstacle to becoming risk savvy. While there are things we can know, we must also be able to recognize when we cannot know something. We know almost for sure that Halley’s Comet will return in the year 2062, but we can rarely predict natural disasters and stock crashes. “Only fools, liars, and charlatans predict earthquakes,” said Charles Richter, namesake of the scale that measures their magnitude.5 Similarly, an analysis of thousands of forecasts by political and economic experts revealed that they rarely did better than dilettantes or dart-throwing chimps.6 But what the experts were extremely talented at was inventing excuses for their errors (“I was almost right”). The problem is that false certainty can do tremendous damage. As we will see, blind faith in tests and financial forecasts can lead to misery. Not only can it endanger your physical and mental health, but it can also ruin your bank account and the economy as a whole. We have to learn to live with uncertainty. It’s time to face up to it. A first step toward doing so is to understand the distinction between known risks and unknown risks.Risk and UncertaintyTwo magnificently dressed young women sit upright on their chairs, calmly facing each other. Yet neither takes notice of the other. Fortuna, the fickle, wheel-toting goddess of chance, sits blindfolded on the left while human figures desperately climb, cling to, or tumble off the wheel in her hand (Figure 2-2). Sapientia, the calculating and vain deity of science, gazes into a hand-mirror, lost in admiration of herself. These two allegorical figures depict a long-standing polarity: Fortuna brings good or bad luck, depending on her mood, but science promises certainty.Figure 2-2. Fortuna, the wheel-toting goddess of chance (left), facing Sapientia, the divine goddess of science (right). In this sixteenth-century woodcut, the two women are pictured in their traditional opposition: Fortune’s luck makes people climb and fall from her wheel, while science promises certainty. A century later, in one of the greatest scientific revolutions, chance became tamed and science lost its certainty. Courtesy of the Bridgeman Art Library, London.This sixteenth-century woodcut was carved a century before one of the greatest revolutions in human thinking, the “probabilistic revolution,” colloquially known as the taming of chance. Its domestication began in the mid-seventeenth century. Since then, Fortuna’s opposition to Sapientia has evolved into an intimate relationship, not without attempts to snatch each other’s possessions. Science sought to liberate people from Fortuna’s wheel, to banish belief in fate, and replace chances with causes. Fortuna struck back by undermining science itself with chance and creating the vast empire of probability and statistics.7 After their struggles, neither remained the same: Fortuna was tamed, and science lost its certainty.Today, we live in the mesmerizing world these two allegorical figures created. Our minds have become crowded with numbers and probabilities. Baseball grew out of sandlots and city streets, supported by a culture of working men and farm boys. Now it is unthinkable without statistics: batting averages, strikeout averages, and playing the percentages. If forced to choose, many a fan would prefer seeing the numbers to the game. Markets and trading emerged from daring, worldly-wise men who voyaged across empires and made their fortunes, surpassing the ruling aristocracy in wealth and eventually initiating a revolution so that others without titles of nobility could live a decent life. Today, traders no longer venture to make their fortunes on the road but on their high-speed computers with the help of mathematical models aimed at predicting the stock market. All the while blindfolded Fortuna is still at work, calmly spinning her wheel, fooling forecasters and plunging Nobel laureates’ hedge funds into ruin.The twilight of uncertainty comes in different shades and degrees. Beginning in the seventeenth century, the probabilistic revolution gave humankind the skills of statistical thinking to triumph over Fortuna, but these skills were designed for the palest shade of uncertainty, a world of known risk, in short, risk (Figure 2-3, center). I use this term for a world where all alternatives, consequences, and probabilities are known. Lotteries and games of chance are examples. Most of the time, however, we live in a changing world where some of these are unknown: where we face unknown risks, or uncertainty (Figure 2-3, right). The world of uncertainty is huge compared to that of risk. Whom to marry? Whom to trust? What to do with the rest of one’s life? In an uncertain world, it is impossible to determine the optimal course of action by calculating the exact risks. We have to deal with “unknown unknowns.” Surprises happen. Even when calculation does not provide a clear answer, however, we have to make decisions. Thankfully we can do much better than frantically clinging to and tumbling off Fortuna’s wheel. Fortuna and Sapientia had a second brainchild alongside mathematical probability, which is often passed over: rules of thumb, known in scientific language as heuristics.8 When making decisions, the two sets of mental tools are required:   • RISK: If risks are known, good decisions require logic and statistical thinking.   • UNCERTAINTY: If some risks are unknown, good decisions also require intuition and smart rules of thumb.Most of the time, a combination of both is needed. Some things can be calculated, others not, and what can be calculated is often only a crude estimate.Figure 2-3. Certainty, risk, and uncertainty. In everyday language, we make a distinction between “certainty” and “risk,” but the terms “risk” and “uncertainty” are mostly used as synonyms. They aren’t. In a world of known risks, everything, including the probabilities, is known for certain. Here, statistical thinking and logic are sufficient to make good decisions. In an uncertain world, not everything is known, and one cannot calculate the best option. Here, good rules of thumb and intuition are also required.Known RiskThe taming of chance created mathematical probability. I will use the term known risk or simply risk for probabilities that can be measured empirically, as opposed to uncertainties that cannot.9 Probabilities of rain, for instance, can be measured on the basis of observed frequencies, as can batting averages and the risk of thrombosis. Originally, the word “risk” referred not just to dangers or harms but also to both good or bad fortunes in Fortuna’s hands: A risk can be a threat or a hope. I will retain the original use of the word. After all, without risk taking there would be little innovation. And in many situations, a negative outcome can be viewed as positive from another perspective: A probability of rain can refer to a dangerous event, such as heavy rain causing car accidents, but also to a positive outcome, such as rain ending drought and famine. The risk of losing your fortune in a gambling casino is a calamity for you but a welcome one for the casino owners.The Three Faces of ProbabilityOne important fact is often overlooked. Probability is not one of a kind; it was born with three faces: frequency, physical design, and degrees of belief.10 And these have persisted to this day.Frequency. In the first of its identities, probability is about counting. Counting the number of days with rainfall or the number of hits a baseball player makes and dividing these by the total number of days or strikes results in probabilities that are relative frequencies. Their historical origins lie in seventeenth-century mortality tables, from which life insurances calculated probabilities of death.Physical Design. Second, probability is about constructing. For example, if a die is constructed to be perfectly symmetrical, then the probability of rolling a six is one in six. You don’t have to count. Similarly, mechanical slot machines are physically designed to pay out, say, 80 percent of what people throw in, and electronic machines have software that determines the probabilities. Probabilities by design are called propensities. Historically, games of chance were the prototype for propensity. These risks are known because people crafted, not counted, them.Degrees of Belief. Third, probability is about degrees of belief. A degree of belief can be based on anything from experience to personal impression. Historically, its origin is in eyewitness testimony in courts and, more spectacularly, in the Judeo-Christian lore of miracles.11 To this day, the testimony of two independent witnesses counts more than that of two who talked with each other beforehand, and the same holds for the testimony of a witness who did not know the defendant than that of his brother. But how to quantify these intuitions? That was the question that gave rise to degrees of belief expressed as probabilities.Unlike known risks based on measurable frequencies or physical design, degrees of belief can be quite subjective and variable. Frequencies and design limit probability to situations involving large amounts of data or a design that is clearly understood. Degrees of belief, in contrast, are more expansive, suggesting that probability can be applied to any and every problem. The danger is that by extending probability to everything, it is easy to be seduced into thinking that one tool—calculating probabilities—is sufficient for dealing with all kinds of uncertainty. As a consequence, other important tools, such as rules of thumb, are left in the cupboard.Does this multiplicity of identities matter? Not much when playing dice, but it certainly does when it comes to modern technology. The risk of a major accident in a nuclear power plant can be estimated by counting earlier accidents, or by the physical design of the plant, or by experts’ degrees of belief, or some mixture of these. The resulting estimates can be strikingly different. While counting nuclear accidents is straightforward, propensities are hard to determine for the design of a power plant, allowing for widely diverging estimates that may depend on the estimators’ political attitudes and on their financial backer. For that reason, it is always important to ask how the risk of a nuclear meltdown, or any other risk, was actually calculated.The Art of Risk Communication"

Books,"Field's Anatomy, Palpation & Surface Markings Review ""The book starts with a detailed definition of palpation, its application and importance of its use in clinical practice. It has a particular focus on how to improve the art of palpation by giving the reader techniques on how to improve manual dexerity and sensitivity to aid palpation ability...Whilst this book heavily focuses on acquisition of anatomical knowledge through familiarisation of surface markings, it appreciates that palpation skills are developed over many years and that the book is best utilised as an adjunct with other learning methods, reflecting the current diverse trends in academic and clinical practice....Overall this is a very well presented and picture rich book that allows the reader to easily understand surface marking of anatomy and begin to build palpation skills.

Books,"Playground: James Mollison Review The scenes are breathtakingly beautiful and an intriguing snapshot of life in countries as varied as India, Bhutan, Bolivia, Israel, Norway, Italy, Japan and the UK.--The Editors ""Tory Daily "" While Mollison's photographs provide a look at how different schools in the U.K., for instance, look compared to those in Kenya, they're not merely architectural studies. The photographs are teaming with children, and looking at them, you can watch scenes unfold and relationships develop.--Jordan G. Teicher ""Slate "" His images capture the similarities of youthful play across social boundaries and national borders, but also the deep divides of class and privilege that are often put in place long before we're old enough to understand their implications.--Allison Meier ""Hyperallergic "" The images are scenic and delightful, illustrating both the common activity of recreation and the differences in the places children have available to them. Some are wooded, others paved and urban. Some look posh, others hardscrabble. Some are majestic. Some aren't playgrounds at all.--Conor Risch ""PDN "" In previous projects ranging from closeups of apes to group shots of rock-fan disciples, Mollison has shown glimpses of individuality within swaths of sameness, in which detailed study reveals layers of insight. This series continues the trend, depicting schoolchildren romping on playgrounds throughout the globe; their environs vary wildly, from the wilds of Kenya to the cramped modernity of Japan, but their unbridled energy is constant.--Jack Crager ""American Photo "" While on assignment, Mollison expanded the project to include schools in Kenya and eventually trekked around the world, photographing playgrounds in more than a dozen countries. He found an incredible diversity in the schools but, also, a universality in the children's play--particularly with boys.--Paul Makovsky ""Metropolis Magazine "" The photos recall the scenes of fun, embarrassment, relaxation, disappointment and anxiety that plague the playground for a growing brain. Although, in retrospect, the notion of playtime tends to acquire a rose-colored glow, Mollison reminds us of the intensity and calamity that often occurred between classes. The photographer set up his camera during school breaks, capturing multiple frames and then collapsing them into a single composite image, in which a constructed play narrative is created. -Huffington Post The images are stunning in their color and size, and use socio-economic, cultural and political elements as backdrops. - Wired His images capture the similarities of youthful play across social boundaries and national borders, but also the deep divides of class and privilege that are often put in place long before we're old enough to understand their implications. - Hyperallergic While on assignment, Mollison expanded the project to include schools in Kenya and eventually trekked around the world, photographing playgrounds in more than a dozen countries.

""Metropolis Magazine"" "" 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap From Jane Goodall's Introduction: 'In 1859 Darwin shocked much of the world with his theory of evolution. Most people now accept the idea that we have evolved not from the modern great apes - chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans - but a common ancestor: a chimp-like human-like creature who lived some six to seven million years ago. Recent research has revealed startling similarities in the structure of DNA in apes and humans. We differ from chimpanzees by only about one per cent. Chimpanzees and bonobos are closer to humans than they are to gorillas. All three African great apes show more similarities to us than to orangutans. 'In most of the places where they range, the great apes face extinction within the next ten to fifteen years if we do not act to save them. There were probably close to two million chimpanzees across Africa 100 years ago. Today there are no more than 150,000. They are declining in numbers as a result of ever-growing human populations, constantly encroaching the remaining forests, fragmenting remaining habitats, setting snares and hunting. The situation is even worse for mountain gorillas and orangutans. As wild ape numbers decrease, so the population of orphans in sanctuaries is increasing. Chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos are being hunted, along with elephants, antelopes and myriad other species, for food - and not to feed starving people, but to satisfy a taste for 'bushmeat' among the urban elite. There is not much meat on an infant ape, so often it will be sold alive, illegally, in the market beside the cut-up body of its mother. 'James Mollison's portraits are of the orphans, confiscated from illegal traders, that make up thepopulation of at least nine seven sanctuaries in Africa and Asia. Many of them have seen their mothers killed, and sometimes butchered, in front of them. Each individual ape has his or her own tragic story of pain and trauma. Each one is different. Look into the eyes of each one of them and you will sense their unique personality. 'I hope that James and Other Apes will stimulate thinking, and help people to understand better our place in nature. For many it will be a humbling experience. We are different from other animals (as they are different from each other) but not as different as we thought.' ((c) Jane Goodall) 				    	 					              See all Product description"

Books,"The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe From AudioFile Physicist Stephen Hawking suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The condition has progressed to the point where he can no longer speak for himself. Hawking, therefore, uses a voice synthesizer to deliver this series of popular lectures on black holes, current physics theories, and the nature of time and space. The synthesizer paces sentences oddly and slurs an occasional word; Hawking jokes about being unable to get rid of its American accent. However, listeners will soon adapt to the oddities of delivery, and once they do, will find themselves inspired by the sweep and clarity of Hawking's mind, and by his warmth and bravery.

Books,"History of Indian Archaeology: The Beginning to 1947 Book Summary of AHistory Of Indian Archaeology From The Beginning To 1947 The history of Indian archaeology has not received the academic attention it deserves. It has a number of roots, the earliest of which goes back to the records of European travellers and sailors in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Concerned with the evolving panorama of the Indian archaeological scene as a whole till 1947, this is the first major work of its kind. The author moves with an easy assurance, clarity and precision over a vast and diverse body of literature. The volume is further enriched by the inclusion of two original documents relating to Alexander Cunningham and Lord Curzon. This is a book which nobody with an interest in South Asian archaeology can possible afford to ignore."

From AudioFile The classical scholar and author says that war occurs in five contexts--when we execute it individually, with an army of some kind, from an offensive position, from a defensive position, and through unconventional, or dirty, means. The suggestions and ideas behind this lesson are thoroughly illustrated with concise historical vignettes. Deftly balancing theory and practice, the author asks listeners to examine their options for handling conflict, understand the meaning of their past experiences, and commit themselves fully to a mature and appropriate response to conflict. He has an impressive understanding of the psychological and organizational challenges in warfare. Don Leslie gives a softly intimate reading that sounds aptly erudite but not overly intense. Pacing himself steadily, he organizes the thick sentences and dense ideas with finesse. T.W. © AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- Copyright © AudioFile, Portland, Maine"

Books,"New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future Review “New Dark Age is among the most unsettling and illuminating books I’ve read about the Internet, which is to say that it is among the most unsettling and illuminating books I’ve read about contemporary life.” – New Yorker “Lucidly argues how our enthusiasm for, and reliance on technology is working against us by undermining our ability to reliably anticipate future risks … Bridle’s multidisciplinary research deftly hopscotches across science, politics and the arts.”—Frieze “I expect many readers will find Bridle’s perceptive and throught provoking book terrifying rather than enjoyable.”—Will Self, Guardian “Highlights the ways in which we are deliberately being kept in the dark and are sleepwalking into a future of non-stop surveillance and ‘the dark clouds [gathering] over our dreams of the digital sublime.’”—Financial Times [summer books of 2018] “My copy of this book is full of underlining and notes that climb around the margins. I feel like those overwhelmed organic chemistry students, highlighting everything because it all matters and it all connects, and yet ultimately the information world he’s describing—none of it makes sense. Which is kind of his point … Dense, demanding, and totally compelling.” —Barbara Fister, Inside Higher Education “An extraordinary, perceptive analysis of the various ways in which the rise of information technology has obscured, rather than illuminated, the operations of power in the world, and diminished our capacity to improve it. It’s brilliant and bracing.”—Mark O Connell, author of To Be a Machine, Guardian (Summer reads selection)“James Bridle is a master of finding contradictions within existing technologies [and] New Dark Age is an important text for the present moment.”—Bernard Hay, The Quietus “A masterful study of all the things approaching out of the future’s night. Compelling and essential.” —Warren Ellis, author of Normal and Transmetropolitan  “James Bridle, one of our surest guides, here offers us a widely informed, deeply felt, and occasionally terrifying course on living in and with the enveloping darkness of our time. It’s a must-read for anyone who’s ever wondered how we might come to terms with technological complexity, and emerge with our humanity intact.”—Adam Greenfield, author of Radical Technologies“Computation brings humanity more darkness than enlightenment: a goblin horde of digital superstitions, invented and unleashed in just half a century. Yet James Bridle is fearless in our gloomy post-truth predicament; he’s a theorist, artist, technical visionary and even a moralist. Has he foreseen the worst?”—Bruce Sterling, author of Pirate Utopia“Technology is not the answer. Nor is it a solution. James Bridle’s lucid and fearless writing instead insists on technology as an open question and urgent problem—which nevertheless needs to be confronted in order to think the present and free the future from false algorithmic certainties.”—Hito Steyerl, author of Duty Free Art “One image that I cannot get out of my head reading James Bridle extraordinary new book is that even as we can access vast tech capabilities we may actually know less and less.” —Saskia Sassen, author of Expulsions “A book-length argument for the idea that vastly proliferating knowledge—from mass surveillance, social media, artificial intelligence, and other sources—is paradoxically making the world harder to comprehend, while the technology that underlies it is creating environmental damage that we’re ill-equipped to understand or solve … Highly nuanced in its analysis of technology, and it provokes [one] to think more about the unspoken social and political assumptions underlying a lot of [the] industry.” —The Verge “An Orwell of the computer age.” —Kirkus“A startling call to arms. Argues convincingly for a more informed integration with the technologies we have created.”—Ben Eastham, ArtReview“The young British artist is spearheading a conceptual-art movement—‘the New Aesthetic’—through Tumblr, Twitter, and Instagram, as he tries to capture technology’s strange effects on society.”—Vanity Fair“A doomy overture to a new era. A work of digital gothic in which the chills are provided by the unpredictable and unstoppable forces we’ve unleashed on the world in the decades since the Manhattan Project.”—Hettie Judah, Vice “Powerful insight and useful provocation throughout. Harrowing and fascinating.” —Jamie Bartlett, Spectator “Original and provoking book.” —Pat Kane, New Scientist “As an artist and author whose work explores the contested intersections of capitalism, surveillance, and computer intelligence, Bridle unravels these vexing issues across his new book.” —Tanner Howard, Rhizome “The glorification of technological progress is one of the cornerstones of the contemporary cultural and artistic mainstream, and Bridle justly stands up against it.” —Nikita Dmitriev, Port  An essential read on the key subjects around AI, and the dangerous feedback loops that are currently being produced. —Ben Vickers, Dazed New Dark Age is enlightening but frightening, a dystopian warning about the implications of the convergence of data and robotics, code and quantum computing, science and technology. —David Gorin, Financial Mail Brilliant and beautiful. —The Australian New Dark Age is a paradoxical work, elegiac yet futuristic, which embraces paradox and the limits of knowledge—especially the limits of knowledge that the present moment’s technological advances, political instability, and environmental chaos have conferred upon us. —Tobias Carroll, Literary Hub Foreboding, at times terrifying, but ultimately motivating account of our technological present … He insists that what is needed is not understanding, but a new language, new metaphors—a new image—that would allow us to look at the darkness directly and—hopefully—begin to see. —Orit Gatt, The White Review Touching on a wide variety of topics, including search algorithms, surveillance, climate change, and many more, Bridle makes a compelling case for pumping the brakes on technology to allow ethics to catch up. —World Literature Today “[James Bridle’s] approach is more accurate than the ahistorical meme that everything is suddenly fake, and more exciting than the truth-hustling of disoriented pundits.” —Nathan Jurgenson, Real Life Magazine “Whichever way the reader veers, the argument that we need better education about technology and more careful thought about what is it for and what is it here to do is a compelling one.” —Tim Sandle, Digital Journal “[James Bridle’s] approach is more accurate than the ahistorical meme that everything is suddenly fake, and more exciting than the truth-hustling of disoriented pundits.” —Nathan Jurgenson, Real Life Magazine “Whichever way the reader veers, the argument that we need better education about technology and more careful thought about what is it for and what is it here to do is a compelling one.” —Tim Sandle, Digital Journal “[New Dark Age] is a shuddering, urgent, brilliant warning about our current direction of travel.” —Hands-Ulrich Obrist, Vulture “Each chapter of New Dark Age provides a different lens that reveals how deeply these imperatives have permeated our social relationships and how opaque they have rendered actual knowledge … [James Bridle] has done us a great service by emphasizing the tangible nature of the infrastructure that constitutes the internet.” —John Thomas, Intercept “[New Dark Age] offers something not often seen from white, male, techno-culture writers (of which there are seemingly so many): an acute sensitivity and unwavering commitment to earthly environments—soil and water—which are profoundly affected by the growth of technological industry.” —Lindsay LeBlanc, Prefix Photo “An unsettling but perceptive read.” —Wired, Best Books of 2018  About the Author James Bridle is a writer, journalist, technologist, and visual artist.
