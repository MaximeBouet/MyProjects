63,1258,Household,"The Attic French Bar Cabinet (Walnut) A classy product made of premium solid wood. Solid wood is a living, breathing material. It ages over time like any natural material. Natural solid wood has characteristics which include knots, variations in grain, and colour differences. Seasoning and drying the wood reduces splitting and warping, but some natural movement is to be expected. Changes in climate and weather cause solid wood furniture to move. Knots are imperfections that happen during the growth of the tree. Grain differences are caused by the way the tree is cut. Each board will have a different grain direction. Natural colour variations are created during the tree growth. The colour of the wood is determined by where the piece was positioned within the tree. Lighter pieces are the ones closer to the bark while the darker pieces are the ones closer to the centre of the tree."

The pump is intended as a temporary replacement for vacuum cleaner when access to one is not available such as when travelling, camping or on holiday. So, though possible, using the pump only will be exhausting and is not recommended.   Usage Tips:   For best results: Always drag the slider back and forth few times over the sliding area at the top of the bag. Press down a little harder to ensure a tight seal has been made, so that no air will be let in later. If the slider-gripper piece comes off, slide it back onto the bag by pushing it back in over the edge of the bag until it clicks twice downward.  * We pride in superior customer service and want to address any negative feedback directly when you buy our product and are not satisfied for whatever reason.

736,20067,Books,"Parsi Food and Drink and Customs Review I like this book because it has a lot of recipes I remember and has become a regular used book --By 24321431 13 Jun. 2014For those that do not know, the term ""Parsi"" refers to people of the Zoroastrian/Zarathusti religion who left Iran and migrated to India over a thousand years ago to avoid religious persecution. There are only approximatley 150,000 Parsi's in the world today, predominantly in India, but scattered world side. The Parsi's have their own culture and cuisine which is very different from that of the rest of India. The first 86 pages of this book are about Parsi customs, including Navjote (a Bat Mitzvah like ceremony), marriage, death, Navroz (new year), etc... The next 300+ pages consist of recepies compiled by the author from a variety of sources (although mainly her family's recepies) including multiple recepies for the same dish for you to pick and choose from (i.e. there are 2 alternative recepies for dhan sakh, plus alternative recepies for masala ni dar, val ni dar, etc...). The book has the best recepie for Dhan Sakh I've tasted outside of India. The only problem is not being in India, some of the ingredients and measurements will have to be translated/converted to make sense (i.e. some recepies ask for 1 1/2 kilos of lamb, 100g cholai bhaji, etc...). Definitely get this book if you either are Parsi and trying to cook like mamaiji used to, or are interested in trying a completely new and unique food that you will never find in any Indian restaurant. --By Behram ParekhI bought this book for my wife who has been using it for the last 10 years at least. The first book has seen better days and needs replacing, hence the purchase. You can't get much better when cooking Parsi dishes. I would recommend it to anyony, having sampled the end products. --By Sarosh J. Ghandy 16 July 2014"

The stories are simple and thought provoking and pertain to the time the author spent as a child and teenager in the foothills of Himalayas i.e Dehra and Mussorrie. Most of the stories run into 2 or 3 pages. There are a couple of them which were part of my English syllabus while I was studying in school. As Bond himself mentions in the preface of the book, his stories are not about espionage, mystery, suspense or murder. Rather these are simple stories of simple folk in the pure and unspoilt land of the hills, forests, the bazaars and its flora and fauna. Since I belong to the hills probabaly I can relate more to its little towns, villages and its folk. However this is precisely the message Bond tries to convey. i.e he will make you connect and feel the anguish, sorrow, pain and joy of mundane events which many of us do not even register in our minds. Admist the hustle and bustle of city life and its rat race, Ruskin Bond's stories are the perfect dose to make you think and ponder about the beauty hidden in the simplest of events. --DHIRAJ SHARMA Aug 13, 2012A Sleepy Indian Railway Station, Natives waiting for the Night Train to Deoli, so, how's this a story?

There are books that give you great strategies for selling, marketing and planning your business.

771,20863,Books,"One-straw Revolution: Introduction to Natural Farming Review The One-Straw Revolution is one of the founding documents of the alternative food movement, and indispensable to anyone hoping to understand the future of food and agriculture. Michael Pollan Fukuoka's do-nothing approach to farming is not only revolutionary in terms of growing food, but it is also applicable to other aspects of living, (creativity, child-rearing, activism, career, etc.) His holistic message is needed now more than ever as we search for new ways of approaching the environment, our community and life. It is time for us all to join his 'non-movement. Keri Smith author of How to be an Explorer of the World Japan s most celebrated alternative farmer...Fukuoka s vision offers a beacon, a goal, an ideal to strive for. Tom Philpott, The One-Straw Revolution shows the critical role of locally based agroecological knowledge in developing sustainable farming systems. Sustainable Architecture With no ploughing, weeding, fertilizers, external compost, pruning or chemicals, his minimalist approach reduces labour time to a fifth of more conventional practices. Yet his success in yields is comparable to more resource-intensive methods...The method is now being widely adopted to vegetate arid areas. His books, such as The One-Straw Revolution have been inspirational to cultivators the world over. New Internationalist. --New Internationalist 				    	 					 About the Author Masanobu Fukuoka (1913 2008) was born and raised on the Japanese island of Shikoku. He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for number of years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II, he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production, managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war, he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975, distressed by the effects of Japan s post-war modernization, Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years, Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties, and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Frances Moore Lappé is author or co-author of sixteen books, including Diet for a Small Planet and Getting a Grip: Clarity, Creativity, and Courage in a World Gone Mad.

He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) that make data science easier, faster and more fun. His work includes packages for data science (the tidyverse: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, readr) and principled software development (roxygen2, testthat, devtools). He is also a writer, educator and frequent speaker promoting the use of R for data science.Garrett Grolemund maintains shiny.rstudio website, the development center for the Shiny R package and is the author of Hands-On Programming with R as well as R for Data Science, a forthcoming book by O'Reilly Media. Garrett is a Data Scientist and Professional Educator at RStudio, Inc. In his own words: I specialize in teaching people how to use R - and especially Hadley Wickham's R packages - to do insightful, reliable data science. Hadley was my dissertation advisor at Rice University, where I gained a first-hand understanding of his R libraries. While at Rice, I taught (and helped developed) the courses ""Statistics 405: Introduction to Data Analysis,"" and ""Visualization in R with ggplot2"". Before that, I taught introductory statistics as a Teaching Fellow at Harvard University. I'm very passionate about helping people analyze data better. I have travelled as far as New Zealand, where R was born, to learn new ways to teach data science. I worked alongside some of the original developers of R to hone my programming skills and I collaborated with the New Zealand government in a nationwide project to improve how New Zealand teaches data analysis to new statisticians. Back in the states, I focused my doctoral research on developing pragmatic principles that guide data science. These principles create a foundation for learning R, which is a bit of a layer cake. R is a set of tools for implementing statistical methods and statistical methods are themselves a set of tools for learning from data. Like all toolkits, R gives its best results to those who use it wisely. Outside of teaching, I have spent time doing clinical trials research, legal research and financial analysis. I also develop R software. I co-authored the `lubridate` R package, which provides methods to parse, manipulate and do arithmetic with date-times and I wrote the `ggsubplot` package, which extends `ggplot2`. I'm also the Editor-in-chief of RStudio's Shiny Development Center, the official resource for learning to use the shiny package to make interactive web apps with R."

Ray's was a more serious, socially conscious cinema examining contemporary issues. His first features, the famous Apu trilogy (Pather Panchali, Aparajito, Apu Sansar), introduced Indian film to the West and made Ray a cultural hero in India. These essays written over a period of 25 years reflect Ray's insights into Indian cinema, his own career, and such other great filmmakers as Charles Chaplin, Jean Renoir, the Italian neorealists, Akira Kurasawa, and John Ford. They resemble the work of the 1950s French intellectuals who wrote for Cahiers du Cinema before turning to filmmaking themselves, and in them Ray proves his adeptness as a writer and as an auteur. This collection is published in conjunction with the restoration and rerelease of some of Ray's major films. Benjamin Segedin"

Mr. Rajan ... argues that the actions of these players (and others) unfolded on a larger world stage, that was (and is) subject to the imperatives of political economies... [A] serious and thoughtful book.""--New York Times ""In a new book ... entitled Fault Lines, Rajan argues that the initial causes of the breakdown were stagnant wages and rising inequality. With the purchasing power of many middle-class households lagging behind the cost of living, there was an urgent demand for credit. The financial industry, with encouragement from the government, responded by supplying home-equity loans, subprime mortgages, and auto loans... The side effects of unrestrained credit growth turned out to be devastating--a possibility most economists had failed to consider.""--John Cassidy, New Yorker ""The book, published by Princeton University Press, saw off stiff competition from five others on the shortlist, to be chosen as 'the most compelling and enjoyable' business title of 2010. The final intense debate among the seven judges came down to a choice between Fault Lines and Too Big to Fail, Andrew Ross Sorkin's acclaimed minute-by-minute analysis of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The book identifies the flaws that helped cripple the world financial system, prescribes potential remedies, but also warns that unless policymakers push through painful reforms, the world could be plunged into renewed turmoil.""--Financial Times ""The left has figured out who to blame for the financial crisis: Greedy Wall Street bankers, especially at Goldman Sachs. The right has figured it out, too: It was government's fault, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business says it's more complicated: Fault lines along the tectonic plates of the global economy pushed big government and big finance to a financial earthquake. To him, this was a Greek tragedy in which traders and bankers, congressmen and subprime borrowers all played their parts until the drama reached the inevitably painful end. (Mr. Rajan plays Cassandra, of course.) But just when you're about to cast him as a University of Chicago free-market stereotype, he surprises by identifying the widening gap between rich and poor as a big cause of the calamity.""--David Wessel, Wall Street Journal ""[E]xcellent... [Fault Lines] deserve[s] to be widely read in a time when the tendency to blame everything on catch-all terms like 'globalisation' is gaining ground.""--Economist ""[C]onvincing.""--Christopher Caldwell, New York Times Magazine ""Fault Lines is a must-read.""--Nouriel Roubini, Forbes.com ""What if the financial crash of 2008 was really caused by income inequality? Not greedy bankers, not reckless homeowners, but the ever widening-gulf between the rich and the poor? And what if the lack of social services--like health care--made things much, much worse? This is the startling new theory from Raghuram Rajan... [Fault Lines is] especially fascinating because it mixes free-market Chicago School economics with good-government ideas straight out of Obamaland.""--John Richardson, Esquire.com ""A high-powered yet accessible analysis of the financial crisis and its aftermath, Fault Lines was awarded the FT/Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year. Rajan ... was one of the few who warned that the crisis was coming and his book fizzes with striking and thought-provoking ideas.""--Financial Times (FT Critics Pick 2010) ""What caused the crisis? ... There is an embarrassment of causes--especially embarrassing when you recall how few people saw where they might lead. Raghuram Rajan ... was one of the few to sound an alarm before 2007. That gives his novel and sometimes surprising thesis added authority. He argues in his excellent new book that the roots of the calamity go wider and deeper still.""--Clive Crook, Financial Times ""A thought-provoking new book... [Rajan's] voice is worth listening to.""--Martin Wolf, Financial Times ""Few people were able to foresee the recent economic downturn. Raghuram Rajan ... was one of them. This makes his new book, Fault Lines, worthy of consideration amidst the rampant speculation about the causes of the financial crisis... Fault Lines is valuable primarily for its clear explanation of unintended economic consequences from well-meaning government intervention.""--Washington Times ""Rajan's writing is clear and direct.""--James Pressley, Bloomberg News ""Former IMF chief economist Raghuram G. Rajan ... in his new book, Fault Lines, brings together and explains the diverse failings that contributed to the crisis--the fault lines, as he puts it, that were exposed by the events of the past several years. Rajan then puts forward broad policy recommendations to ward off a future problem... Rajan's book takes a comprehensive look at what got us into the crisis and offers an intriguing approach to avoiding another one.""--Phillip Swagel, Finance & Development ""I devoured Raghuram Rajan's Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy in a very short span of time last night. It's brief, well-written, and extremely interesting. I would definitely recommend adding it to your financial crisis reading list.""--Matthew Yglesias, Yglesias blog ""Rajan is worth reading not just because he was correct when few were but also because his writing is clear as a bell, even to nonspecialists.""--Christopher Caldwell, Weekly Standard ""The proposed global reforms that [Rajan] lists in Fault Lines run the gamut from the prosaic to grandiose. Along with revamping Wall Street's pay system, he offers innovative ideas on building capital buffers into the global credit system, obviating much of the need for bailouts of companies deemed too big or too enmeshed in the financial system to fail.""--Barron's ""Economists who can challenge their peers while remaining accessible to the general reader are rare, but Rajan belongs to this elite group. No short summary can do justice to this well-written, insightful, and nuanced study.""--Choice ""In 2007, then-chief IMF economist Raghuram G. Rajan delivered a stark warning to the world's top bankers: financial markets were headed for doom. They laughed it off. In the wake of the collapse that followed, Rajan has written a new book, Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy, that warns the system is doomed to repeat its mistakes. Like many defenders of the market, Rajan urges us not to demonize the bankers. But it's this fiscal conservative's focus on inequality that makes him stand out from the pack. The growing wage gap, he argues, is a hidden driver of financial instability, putting constant pressure on politicians to enact short-term fixes.""--Toronto Star ""The critics are wrong: Raghuram Rajan's analysis of the global financial crisis remains highly relevant and deserves to be widely read... The breadth of Rajan's explanatory framework--which is presented cogently and concisely within 230 pages of text--marks this book apart from many others that tackle the same themes.""--Mark Hannam, Prospect ""Dozens of experts have explored the reasons behind the ongoing global economic turmoil, and Raghuram Rajan provides his own elegant and thoughtful analysis in Fault Lines.""--BizEd ""With Fault Lines, Rajan has made an original diagnosis of the credit crisis, one that goes much further than those of greedy bankers or wasteful mortgage giants such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.""--Christophe De Rijcke, De Tijd (translated from the Dutch by K.C.L.) ""A book that should be the default choice of discerning finance professionals when they enter the store the next time.""--D. Murali, Business Line ""Rajan's Fault Lines is ... expansive and policy-focused and clearly destined to become a must-read on any list of books on the recent global crisis.""--Jahangir Aziz, Business Standard ""Insightful, educative and incredibly gripping, if you want just one book to understand the ongoing global financial crisis and the way forward, Fault Lines it is.""--Gautam Chikermane, Hindustan Times ""Best Crisis Book by an Economist (2010).""--James Pressley, Bloomberg News ""Fault Lines has a strong claim to be the economics book that best caught the spirit of 2010. Raghuram Rajan's receipt of the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs annual business book award only confirmed his book's widespread popularity. It is not hard to see why so many people liked it. Fault Lines eschews hyperbole for a lucid and balanced account of the crisis.""--Fund Strategy ""Rajan ... comes up with original and important long-term remedies... Rajan's book is a bold enterprise in three ways: firstly it aims to explain the US financial crisis by looking at deep, decade-long fractures in economies and societies; secondly it suggests well-known but radical solutions that few dare put forward; and finally it supplies innovative answers to practical questions... [T]he book will please any reader looking for an inquiry into the deepest causes of the recession and a consistent account of government's errors of omission and commission.""--Natacha Postel-Vinay, British Politics and Policy ""[Fault Lines]'s great strength is that it is a clearly written work of political economy, accessible to readers who do not have a PhD in economics or finance. Its objective is not to point fingers at the guilty, and it comes to some surprising conclusions.""--Stewart Fleming, European Voice ""Fault Lines is a very well written and cogent book that provides a global perspective on the causes of the crisis, the dangers if the root causes of it are not addressed, possible solutions, and ideas for implementing them... In sum, this book is a must read for analysts, academics, politicians, economists, and the like.""--Emilia Garcia-Appendini, Financial Markets and Portfolio Management 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap ""Fault Lines provides an excellent analysis of the lessons to be learned from the financial crisis, and the difficult choices that lie ahead. Of the many books written in the wake of our recent economic meltdown, this is the one that gets it right.""--George A. Akerlof, coauthor of Animal Spirits and Identity Economics""Amidst the welter of books about our financial crisis, Rajan's book stands out for several reasons: the author's intellectual distinction, his academic and real-world involvement in the problems of finance and the macroeconomy, his global perspective, his search for the roots of the financial crisis in America's growing economic inequality, and also his prescience. In 2005, Rajan foresaw the coming financial collapse--and was fiercely criticized for his insight.""--Richard A. Posner, author ofA Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression""Beautifully clear, cogent, and highly readable. This is the best book out there on the global imbalances that gave us the last financial crisis and might well give us the next one.""--Kenneth S.

854,23855,Books,"The Diary of a Young Girl Amazon.com Review A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. --Wendy Smith  Review “A truly remarkable book.”—The New York Times “One of the most moving personal documents to come out of World War II.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer “The new edition reveals a new depth to Anne’s dreams, irritations, hardship, and passions. . . .

861,23977,Books,"Unbreakable Review I started reading the book last night at around 12 and i could not help but finish the book in one go, till 6 in the morning. The most striking quality of this book is the sincerity and ease with which Mary Kom describes her remarkable journey, almost as if she is writing a fairy tale. The book hooks you on in the initial pages because of the description of the lives and struggles of people in Manipur. It is a fascinating insight into the lives of the people there, so distinct in its culture and methods, and one gets the essence of how much of a diverse country India is. Mary Kom then goes on to describe her various hurdles in such a matter of fact way, that it seems too good to be true. The struggles of her parents during childhood, the politics of sports administration, her romantic life with Onler, pregnancy and motherhood, the world championships, the Olympics, all are compacted into neat chapters in the book. What is evident in most of her struggles is the fierce will with which she deals with them, something that influences her description of her life's events in the book. The resulting breezy narrative therefore holds ones imagination as one moves from one event to the other while giving very little time to marvel at the fact that she actually pulled through. I expected that she would write more about the perspectives of multiculturalism and feminism that her success story brings in. But that is restricted to a few lines about how people from the North-East are discriminated based on their looks and not made to feel a part of the nation. She also mentions about how she would want to inspire the girls from various parts of the country. It is heartening to note that despite all her troubles and lack of recognition for so long, Mary is open to working with the Indian government and has already set up an academy in her native place. The issues of political turmoil in the state of Manipur is also restricted to a few pages about her father-in-law's assassination, a decision that shows how apolitical Mary has been with her dedicated pursuit in sports. All in all, a must read for anybody looking for some inspiration through the unbreakable soul of a great great champion. --Shreyas Rao Jan 19, 2014Unbreakable is the autobiography of M.C . Mary Kom the best Indian boxer a fighter in true sense. How should I describe this book story of ceaseless struggle or strength or honesty? While going through the pages I felt ashamed. I felt ashamed of myself , my excuses , getting disturbed over trivial matters. Mary proudly introduced her father Apa was an uneducated landless labourer who found it hard to make ends meet . I stopped to think who is an educated person? In spite of all sort of hardships he was determined to give best education to his children. Mary said she was proud of her father. So are we. In her childhood Mary had All work and no play . She had to work in fields I would carry home the straw that was left over after harvesting. She would handle heavy farming tools, sacks of rice. She would carry water across long distance. She would help her mother in cooking, washing, gardening. She would accompany her father to bring fire woods. As a little girl she was also envious to see other children playing but she was an undemanding child . After the days work she would sit down on a mat with a smoky kerosene lamp to do her school homework. Looking back she only finds the positive aspect of her hard toil. Should I describe the book as a love story? A story of a wonderful relationship between Onler and I . Mary was telling I met Onler Kom, and though I didn`t know it then , it was a meeting that would change my life completely. Mary got Onler by her side always. She said People refer to Onler as Mary`s husband , but I know that behind Mary`s success there is Onler Unbreakable is the story of achievement and success. It tells us also about sorrow and shame. It tells about The other face of Manipur . Mary`s father- in -law was killed by unknown insurgents. The way people of her own country behave with the people of Manipurof which we should be ashamed . Mary Kom is the psynonym of struggle and success. --Sreya Ghose Aug 20, 2014This is the first biography I've ever read, and am very motivated by this. I was very curious when boxing was introduced for the females in the London Olympics. And was very excited to see Mary contest in it. I always thought about the difficulties she might have been through to come to the ring. Despite having kids, she took the step and never gave up.. I did see the last bout, where Mary lost, but has won millions of hearts, winning a bronze.. Though we got 5 other medals.. this one by Mary was definitely different.. This book tells us all the hardships she went through, and how her ambition rose from getting a decent government job to getting a gold in the Olympics. --vennam anand Dec 22, 2013 				    	 					 About the Author Mangte Chungneijang Mary Kom is a boxer, a World Champion five times over and winner of an Olympic bronze in 2012 - the first time that women's boxing was part of the Olympic Games."

Critical reflection on MacCormick's theory, thus, may indeed by the way to work toward an insightful treatment of reason applied to practical disputes. (Stefano Bertea, Journal of Law and Society, Volume 23, No.3, 2009)The book is clearly written in MacCormick's usual lucid and lively style avoiding technicalities, and a pleasure to read.

It could be the case not only because of the valuable new insight into the old problems invoked in philosophical thoughts achieved by means of dialogue with the contemporary context of legal theory, but also because of the deepness, reflective and proactively original insight presented in MacComick's last book. I strongly recommend this book to every lawyer.

She wrote and self-published her first book, Amma Tell Me About Holi! in 2011 and over the next 3 years, the series has grown with books on the festival of Diwali, the Hindu epic Ramayana and stories about the Hindu gods, Krishna, Ganesha and Hanuman. The real motivation for writing the Amma Tell Me series was to share with my sons the fascinating stories from Indian mythology that I had grown up with, says Bhakti. But, I found that there were no resources that were simple to understand and that captured the rich imagery of mythological India that is such an integral part of these stories for me. So I went ahead and started writing the stories in a style that I think kids find fun and non-preachy and collaborated on the illustrations to bring out the imagery that I want my stories to convey. Bhakti grew-up in Delhi. She studied at Modern School Vasant Vihar. She obtained her graduate degree in Economics and her post graduate degree in Finance from Delhi University. She is a CFA charter holder. She currently works for a major Swiss Bank and lives in Hong Kong with her husband, their two sons and their two dogs.

Her journey is as lyrical and complicated as the sky she describes, and her book is a shimmering parting gift to those still earthbound Source: GuardianSkybound is a soaring gift of a book. A moving meditation on landscapes and the leaving of them, the freedom of travelling beyond our fears and how our journeys between the known and the unknown, the familiar and the unfamiliar can teach us to cherish and see again. Author: Owen SheersIt's early for predictions, but I'm sure Rebecca Loncraine's Skybound is going to be one of my books of the year.

'Learning to fly,' she wrote, 'is like asking the universe . . . to let me go into the world to live and soar with joy and the possibility of death.'

910,25356,Books,"Bruce Lee Striking Thoughts: Bruce Lee's Wisdom for Daily Living (Bruce Lee Library) Review ""Since he himself would not wholly accept any particular style of martial art or philosophy, Bruce encouraged his students not to accept, without question, his teachings. His main message was to keep one's mind, attitude, and senses pliable and receptive, and, at the same time, develop the ability to think correctly. This process of inquiry, debate, and practice would lead not only to knowledge of one's physical strengths and weaknesses but also to the discovery of basic truths that allow one to grow toward a state of harmonious unity of spirit, mind, and body.""—Linda Lee Cadwell, from her preface""He was a teacher first of all. He taught philosophy and tried to spread knowledge and wisdom…The integrity with which Bruce Lee lived his life and tried to uphold what he believed to be right—that is a clear example of how it ought to be done. No matter what it is you're doing, do it with total honesty and total dedication. He definitely influenced me.""—Kareem Abdul-Jabbar""I thought Bruce was a brilliant, fine philosopher about everyday living. He was very much into finding out who he was. His comment to people was 'Know yourself.' The good head that he acquired was through his knowing himself. He and I used to have great long discussions about that. No matter what you do in life, if you don't know yourself, you're never going to be able to appreciate anything in life. That, I think, is today's mark of a good human being—to know yourself.""—Steve McQueen""Bruce's philosophy seemed always to be going back to the Zen origins, where contradictory advice states the simplest of truths. Bruce's lessons were lessons without being lessons; he was not a teacher, yet he was the greatest teacher I've ever known.""—Stirling Silliphant""For every question you asked him he would never have to think about it, he would just blurt it right out. Bruce would cover every point with a little saying. If he would see that you were having trouble with something, he would always know just what to tell you. It would seem like he was always dusting off your 'bogie man.' Like if there was something that you were scared of, Bruce would notice and then say 'Ah, scared of that, well look at it this way.' He would change your whole idea about it. Bruce had sayings for everything.""—Bob Bremer, student of Bruce Lee""We'd work out for an hour, then we'd talk for an hour about a lot of things. He didn't separate life from the extension in his arm. And he is the only one I know of that carried it to the point of real art.""—James Coburn""In the collection of his writings 'Striking Thoughts: Bruce Lee's Wisdom for Daily Living,' Lee explains that there is a difference between the fulfillment of one's desires and the fulfillment of how one desires to appear to the world…""—Business Insider  From the Inside Flap                See all Product description"

The events of the Arab Spring and its aftermath will continue to defy prediction; but in the meantime, it's worth reading Danahar to take stock of some of the geopolitical tectonic shifts and the forces that are remaking our old assumptions.” ―Prospect“He reports perceptively on the internal contradictions of the Jewish state, from militant settlers to the ultraorthodox Haredim.” ―Guardian About the Author Paul Danahar is the BBC's Middle East Bureau Chief and ran the organization's news coverage of the Arab Spring. He has reported from Iraq, Iran and North Korea--every nation in the ""Axis of Evil."" In 2013 he was appointed the BBC's North America Bureau Chief, based in Washington, DC.

1005,27619,Books,"A History of American Literature Review ""Richard Gray's real achievement is somehow to have compressed more than 400 years of thrillingly rich literary history between two covers."" Literary Review ""This book is the first comprehensive, single volume history of American literature since The Columbia Literary History of the United States edited by Elliott Emory and published sixteen years ago. It is a puzzle, given the extraordinary interest in American literature at home and abroad, that so few full histories of American literature have been published. Consider the fact that the Columbia history arrived nearly four decades after R. E. Spiller's Literary History of the United States. What makes Gray's book so extraordinary is that it supercedes the Spiller and Emory texts in nearly every respect, and even challenges the supremacy of the titanic (this pun is intentional), multi-volume, still-evolving Cambridge History of American Literature. How Gray managed to so captivatingly capture the depth and breadth of so complex a literature in under a thousand pages is worth considering. [...] Richard Gray possesses the most balanced scholarship of the entire range of American literature I ever read. [...] This is the first history of American literature fully worthy of the multi-dimensionality of its subject."" Norman Weinstein, Boise State University 				    	 					 From the Back Cover First published in 2004, A History of American Literature is one of the most popular and critically acclaimed surveys of American literature from pre-Columbian times to the present available today. This widely anticipated second edition features a wealth of fresh updates and new material, including a detailed survey of the fiction, drama, and poetry written in response to 9/11 and the war on terror. Other additions include coverage of the cultural consequences of the new era in American politics ushered in by the election of President Obama, and the development of new literary and cultural movements such as the New Formalists.Written in an informed and approachable style by Richard Gray, one of the leading authorities in the field, this survey helps the reader develop a deeper understanding of and insight into the immense breadth of American literary traditions within the context of American social and cultural history. While focusing on the full range of fiction, poetry, drama, and non-fiction that has been incorporated into the mainstream literary canon, Gray also considers popular American literary traditions such as oral literature, folktales, spirituals, Westerns, detective stories, thrillers, and science fiction.Compelling and authoritative, A History of American Literature, Second Edition, continues its tradition of representing an unparalleled introduction to the full breadth and diversity of the American literary tradition.

1007,27809,Books,"Book on Acting: Improvisation Techniques for the Professional Actor in Film, Theater & Television Review Improvisation is essential to acting and Book is a terrific teacher. -- William Hurt  From the Publisher A new technique for improvising performances with scripted and memorized lines. The ability to improvise a skilled performance while speaking scripted and memorized lines is of paramount importance to actors working in todays film and television productions, which often allow very little if any rehearsal time. Through his innovative Improvisation Technique, Stephen Book shows the actor how to create a spontaneous performance by applying improvisation to traditional script-acting for film, theater, and television. Book on Acting begins with immediate training in how to improvise. Books fundamental principle of improvisation is ""Acting is doing, and there is always more to do."" The actor learns what to do to keep himself in a spontaneous improvisational state. This Improvisation Technique is then applied to exercises with scripted lines, developing sophisticated improvisation skills for enhancing character, emotions, conflict, and agreement as well as improving the actors audition process. Also included is a unique process for breaking down scripted scenes into improvisation choices. Book on Acting contains film and television scenes in which Book-coached actors, used his Improvisation Technique to create their performances. These scenes, showing the actors performance choices, demonstrate the use of Improvisation Technique in different genres of acting. Well-known theater and film scenes are included, as well as scenes from such TV shows as Melrose Place, Star Trek: Voyager, L.A. Law, Frasier, and The Practice. Books Improvisation Technique extends the work of Viola Spolin (author of Improvisation for the Theater). Book was Spolins student, assistant, representative, and her partner in the Spolin Theater Game Center in Hollywood, where he served as executive director and principal teacher in the 1970s.

This book redefines what it means to be healthy and eloquently provides the means to manifest that goal.” (David Perlmutter, MD, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Grain Brain and Brain Maker)“Drawing on his vast experience as a practicing gastroenterologist, Dr. Mayer writes about the connections that our brains have with our guts, especially with the microbes that make the gut their home. Describing a rapidly advancing realm of knowledge, this thoughtful guide provides practical advice to improve health.” (Martin J. Blaser, MD, author of Missing Microbes)“Dr. Emeran Mayer elucidates the intricate biochemical dialogue that occurs between the brain, digestive tract, and trillions of bacteria residing in the gut. He dubs this form of communication ‘microbe-speak’ and speculates on its implications for social behavior, decision making, emotional wellbeing, and maybe mental health.” (Booklist)“After a long period of neglect the enteric nervous system has been recognized as the ‘second brain’. Dr. Emeran Mayer, a true expert of this topic, has now written the best lay-public guide yet to this spectacular part of ourselves. Recommended reading.” (Antonio Demasio, author of Descartes’ Error, The Feeling of What Happens, and The Self Comes to Mind)“I have known Emeran Mayer for years and have learned to pay attention to what he says and writes. The Mind-Gut Connection is a delight. Both scholarly and fun to read, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about how the mind and gut communicate.” (Michael D.

Synthesizing recent research with patient stories and personal anecdotes, he offers practical, evidence-based recommendations to keep the dialogue between the brain, the gut, and its microbes flowing smoothly.” (SELF online) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover Chances are, at some point in your life you’ve noticed the connection between your brain and your gut. If you’ve ever felt queasy as you walked into an uncomfortable situation or based a life decision based on a “gut feeling,” then you know that sometimes our bodies react faster than our minds. Most of us have also experienced the same phenomenon in reverse, where our mental state has affected our digestive system—like the butterflies in our stomach before an important meeting or a first date. But while the dialogue between the mind and the gut has been recognized by ancient healing traditions for centuries, scientists today are just starting to understand how powerful and far-reaching that connection is.In The Mind-Gut Connection, Dr. Emeran Mayer offers a cutting-edge view into this developing science, showing us the full impact of how the brain, gut, and microbiome—the community of microorganisms that lives inside the digestive tract—communicate. When this communication system is out of balance, major health problems can crop up, including digestive disorders, obesity, depression, anxiety, food sensitivities, allergies, and fatigue.With a few simple changes to our diet and lifestyle, we can enjoy a happier mind-set, enhanced immunity, a decreased risk of developing neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and even lose weight. With a simple, practical regimen drawn from forty years of clinical practice and the latest research, Dr. Mayer shows us that paying attention to the mind-gut balance is the key to unlocking vibrant health.               See all Product description"

The Anatomy Trains metaphor is a revelation; a way of seeing the body's interconnectedness more clearly, offering new physiological and anatomical perspectives, and therefore different clinical choices. Quite simply the content of this book is revolutionary.  Leon Chaitow ND DO, Honorary Fellow, University of Westminster, Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies  Any body of work that demonstrates the interconnectedness of the body and fosters appreciation of the whole over the sum of available parts is a must in today's health and fitness market. Anatomy Trains champions a wider scope of the body and its movement systems. Gray Cook MSPT, OSPT, CSCS, Developer of the Functional Movement Screen Tom Myers' masterful second edition of Anatomy Trains incorporates the most recent scientific concepts into a framework for understanding and practicing deep tissue work. Readers will gain insight into both basic and clinical research issues, how the science could influence clinical practice, and vice versa. Completely redone illustrations show anatomy from the cellular to the whole body level, describing both structure and function. Clinicians, researchers and educators alike will find this an invaluable text, which leads to new insights on each reading. Thomas Findley MD PhD, Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Editor-in Chief, International Journal of Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork: Research, Education and Practice Using Tom Myers' Anatomy Trains concepts and techniques in my chiropractic practice has improved my ability to see the source of my patient's problem and more efficiently target the soft tissue structures involved. As a result, injuries resolve more quickly, chronic problems respond well, and my adjustments are more effective because they are supported by the soft tissue.

It even makes studying functional anatomy enjoyable. Dr Andry Vleeming, Professor of Clinical Anatomy, co-editor of Movement, Stability and Lumbopelvic Pain The beauty of Tom Myers' work is that it is useful for a wide range of bodyworkers, from movement or energy therapists to manipulative manual specialists, and does more than simply demonstrating rote techniques, Anatomy Trains provides a deep understanding of strain patterns in the body to enable creative and effective solutions for the issues we encounter in a bodywork practice. Art Riggs, Certified Advanced Rolfer Our field is fortunate to have the talent and skill of Tom Myers and his ability to articulate his findings. His study, discoveries and syntheses are clearly defined and easily applicable for anyone who works with the body.

Somatic Pioneer teaching bodywork, movement, and fitness for over 40 years. Anatomy Trains will help physicians, therapists and bodyworkers of all backgrounds break away from the prevalent traditional, mechanistic view of how the body works and is to be treated and will then push you headfirst into a logical, systems oriented view that has helped expand my diagnostic and treatment paradigms as well as my personal practice enormously. Chris Frederick, Physical Therapist, Certified Flexibility Specialist, Professional Structural Integrator, Director Stretch to Win Institute. Training optimal movement patterns requires an understanding of how the body regions connect and work in synergy.

It is this personality combined with a non-scientific writing style, yet supported clearly with scientific references, that makes or breaks the book as a reader. If approached with an open mind then there is a clear working theory that flows throughout the text and even now in its 3rd edition, the book appears novel and rogue.

This book is highly recommended for all veterinarians involved in equine practice.""Cynthia Donnellan VBSc (hons) Mmedvet, April 2008EQUINE INFECTIOUS DISEASESAuthors: D C Sellon and M LongPublisher: SaundersThis is an extremely comprehensive and detailed reference book on infectious diseases of horses with contributions from many world renowned experts in their various fields. It covers both organ system infections and discussion of specific viral, bacterial, rickettsial, fungal and parasitic diseases and has a final section on the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Recognition, treatment and control of infectious diseases remains the cornerstone of clinical equine practice, never more so now climate change is leading to the spread of disease vectors and bringing diseases previously considered exotic to more temperate regions of the world.Inevitably, the book has a North American bias, as the editors are based at North American Universities and the majority of the contributors are based in North America. Nevertheless, this does not detract from its value as a reference book. The chapters are extremely well illustrated and include a wide variety of illustrations of clinical cases, pathological specimens and histological slides. There is extensive discussion of the laboratory diagnosis of each disease with detailed information on the biochemical characterisation of each organism. Detailed references are included on an easy to use CD-ROM.Unfortunately, given the rapidly changing nature of infectious diseases, some subjects are already out of date. For example, no mention is made of the recent Irish outbreak of Equine Infectious Anaemia and the unusual epidemiological features of this outbreak.This is an extremely comprehensive, well illustrated summary of equine infectious disease and I can thoroughly recommend it to all those who wish to obtain detailed summaries of the major equine diseases. The section on Prevention and Control of infectious diseases is particularly useful in illustrating the approach to diagnosis and control of infectious diseases, with detailed discussion of epidemiology, biosecurity and antimicrobial therapy.With the ever increasing international travel of horses and climate changes it has never been more important for equine veterinary surgeons to be alert to the possibilities of new and emerging diseases in the U.K. This book will provide an essential reference for all those wishing to be informed on both familiar and less familiar infectious diseases of horses.Reviewed by David Dugdale at Greenwood Ellis and Partners for EVJ 				    	 					 Review Prevent, diagnose, and treat equine infectious diseases with this comprehensive resource"

1083,29846,Books,"The Origin of Species (Bantam Classic) Amazon.com Review It's hard to talk about The Origin of Species without making statements that seem overwrought and fulsome. But it's true: this is indeed one of the most important and influential books ever written, and it is one of the very few groundbreaking works of science that is truly readable. To a certain extent it suffers from the Hamlet problem--it's full of clichés! Or what are now clichés, but which Darwin was the first to pen. Natural selection, variation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest: it's all in here. Darwin's friend and ""bulldog"" T.H. Huxley said upon reading the Origin, ""How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that."" Alfred Russel Wallace had thought of the same theory of evolution Darwin did, but it was Darwin who gathered the mass of supporting evidence--on domestic animals and plants, on variability, on sexual selection, on dispersal--that swept most scientists before it. It's hardly necessary to mention that the book is still controversial: Darwin's remark in his conclusion that ""Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history"" is surely the pinnacle of British understatement. --Mary Ellen Curtin  From the Inside Flap Perhaps the most readable and accessible of the great works of scientific imagination, The Origin of Species sold out on the day it was published in 1859. Theologians quickly labeled Charles Darwin the most dangerous man in England, and, as the Saturday Review noted, the uproar over the book quickly ""passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street."" Yet, after reading it, Darwin's friend and colleague T. H. Huxley had a different reaction: ""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.""Based largely on Darwin's experience as a naturalist while on a five-year voyage aboard H.M.S. Beagle, The Origin of Species set forth a theory of evolution and natural selection that challenged contemporary beliefs about divine providence and the immutability of species. A landmark contribution to philosophical and scientific thought, this edition also includes an introductory historical sketch and a glossary Darwin later added to the original text. Charles Darwin grew up considered, by his own account, ""a very ordinary boy, rather below the common standard of intellect."" A quirk of fate kept him from the career his father had deemed appropriate--that of a country parson--when a botanist recommended Darwin for an appointment as a naturalist aboard H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. Darwin is also the author of the five-volume work Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle (1839) and The Descent of Man (1871).

[Randall Munroe's] enthusiasm for all things scientific is infectious . . . required reading for grown-ups, it's just fun to remember that science is really, really coolSmart answers to silly questions: Randall Munroe reveals allWhat If? maintains a delightfully free-wheeling tone throughout, especially when complicated calculations lead to whimsical results. Despite all the hard facts and gigantic numbers, it never feels like a textbook-and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to enjoy itThe best bathroom book you'll ever buy...Munroe takes inane, useless and often quite pointless questions asked by real humans (mostly sent to him through his website), and turns them into beautiful expositions on the impossible that illuminate the furthest reaches, almost to the limits, of the modern sciences .The first chapter, ""Q. What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?"" ends with the anthropomorphized moon worrying over the state of the Earth, and, with the gravity generated by its own rotation around the Earth, saving our dying planet. The physics are real; so is the emotional content. . . The answers are all illustrated with xkcd's trademark stick figures.. . . . and these are eminently approachableBrilliantWhat If? includes old favorites, new inquiries and the mix of expert research and accessible wit that has made Munroe a favorite among both geeks and laymenMunroe's brilliant What-If? column-which features scientifically rigorous, utterly absurd answers to ridiculous hypotheticals-has been on the bestseller lists since it was announced in March. Today, it hits shelves and: It. Is. A. Triumph[What If?] has solved my annual birthday-present and holiday-gift dilemmas for a large group of people . . . What makes Munroe's work so fantastic is a combination of two elements: his commitment to trying to answer even the weirdest question with solid science, and his undeniable sense of humour. So, here's a ""What If?"" from me: If everyone on the planet simultaneously bought a copy of this book, stopped what they were doing and read it cover to cover, would modern civilization and our global economy collapse? It's worth trying the experiment.For the record, I'm loving XKCD's What If -- 'Dear Abby for mad scientists'Munroe has hit on a wonderful form of science and engineering communication that can do so much-extolling the value of analytical thinking, examining data, and doing back-of-the-envelope calculations-while entertaining readers at the same time . . . an incredibly fun book with quirky, hand-drawn pictures 				    	 				        	--This text refers to the Kindle Edition edition.

Her survivor's story is both understated and inspiring.I'm very thankful for Roxane Gay's Hunger, which should be and should have been on every award list if people were really reading. This is her best book, in my opinion. I love that it takes an unconventional road to storytelling and that the structure often spirals within itself in interesting ways. I also love that it is a story about sexual assault and the ways in which that can change your life. It's a deeply moving, somewhat experimental, gorgeously written and brilliantly thought-out memoir. And it's one of those books that no matter what your relationship to the body, this book is for you, all of you.This whip-smart book takes on everythingIn 88 short, lucid chapters, Gay powerfully takes readers through realities that pain her, vex her, guide her, and inform her work. The result is a generous and empathic consideration of what it's like to be someone else: in itself something of a miracle.It turns out that when a wrenching past is confronted with wisdom and bravery, the outcome can be compassion and enlightenment - both for the reader who has lived through this kind of unimaginable pain, and for the reader who knows nothing of it. Roxane Gay shows us how to be decent to ourselves, and decent to one another.

The timeless message of the book is that we are each responsible for our own reality and ""dis-ease."" Hay believes we make ourselves ill by having thoughts of self-hatred. She includes a directory of ailments and emotional causes for each with a corresponding affirmation to help overcome the illness. For example, the probable cause of multiple sclerosis is ""mental hardness, hard-heartedness, iron will, and inflexibility.""

The affirmations of her book are truly healing and it really heals you physically and mentally. Believe it or not, for someone who was physically and mentally ill for years, this book helped me a lot and completely made over my life.

This book does not follow a traditional grammar approach. All research points towards teaching language skills in real contexts not the grammar (structure) itself. I'm using this book to teach English grammar to my son who is in class two. He is enjoying the book so much that he looks forward to every evening to catch up with me for the next lesson. His spoken English has improved vastly with the help of this book. The book is intuitively organized to readily facilitate assimilation of English fundamentals for speaking or writing. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Cheers….

This is a masterful, philosophical and practical book that will give readers the wisdom to be able to do just that.” (Ryan Holiday, New York Times bestselling author of The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy)“Mark’s ability to dig deep and offer amazing, yet counter-intuitive, insight into the challenges of life makes him one of my favorite writers, and this book is his best work yet.” (Matt Kepnes, New York Times bestselling author of Travel the World on $50 a Day: Travel Cheaper, Longer, Smarter)“This book hits you like a much-needed slap in the face from your best friend: hilarious, vulgar, and immensely thought-provoking. Only read if you’re willing to set aside all excuses and take an active role in living a f***ing better life.” (Steve Kamb, bestselling author of Level Up Your Life and founder of NerdFitness.com)“The opposite of every other book. Don’t try. Give up. Be wrong. Lower your standards. Stop believing in yourself. Follow the pain. Each point is profoundly true, useful, and more powerful than the usual positivity. Succinct but surprisingly deep, I read it in one night.” (Derek Sivers, Founder of CD Baby and author of Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur)“An in-your-face guide to living with integrity and finding happiness in sometimes-painful places… This book, full of counterintuitive suggestions that often make great sense, is a pleasure to read and worthy of rereading. A good yardstick by which self-improvement books should be measured.” (Kirkus Reviews) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger shows us that the key to being stronger, happier people is to handle adversity better and stop trying to be “positive” all the time.For the past few years, Mark Manson—via his wildly popular blog—has been working on correcting our delusional expectations for ourselves and for the world. He now brings his hard-fought wisdom to this groundbreaking book. Manson makes the argument that human beings are flawed and limited. As he writes, “not everybody can be extraordinary—there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.” Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them—this, he says, is the real source of empowerment. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties—once we stop running from and avoiding, and start confronting, painful truths—we can begin to find the courage and confidence we desperately seek.“In life, we have a limited amount of fucks to give. So you must choose your fucks wisely.” Manson brings a much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eyes moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor. This manifesto is a refreshing slap in the face for all of us, so that we can start to lead more contented, grounded lives.              See all Product description"
